This approach is inherently robust to tactics involving visual modifications. The paper's evaluation section provides an exemplary analysis of tactic diversity. The authors systematically test the model against a wide array of visual evasion tactics, including seven distinct types of hand-crafted image perturbations (blurring, noise, occlusion, shifting, etc.) and white-box adversarial machine learning attacks (FGSM). Crucially, the paper provides a quantitative breakdown of detection performance for each of these evaluated tactics, showing the relative drop in matching accuracy and ROC AUC. Furthermore, it explicitly evaluates the model's performance against unseen \"zero-day\" pages, demonstrating its ability to handle novel attack campaigns. The discussion also provides a qualitative analysis of successful detections, categorizing them by the difficulty of visual mimicry (from exact copies to pages with large design disparities). This comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of specific tactics demonstrates a deep consideration of tactic diversity.",

For example, he might know that some PDs consider the ratio of internal links ... to external links. Hence, in this attack, he inserts a number of “internal” links to his URL domain that might fool classifiers that use this feature.\"\n2. **Page 5, Section 4.2, Complex Attacks**: The paper introduces a generalized adversarial model where the attacker can manipulate a subset of known features. \"In our more sophisticated attacks GBA-Δ, the adversary knows a variable subset of the features used by the defender... This family of attacks is based on Δ, the percentage of features actually used by the defender that the attacker guessed correctly... The 27 basic features used (cf.

These include hiding target brand names in the URL path (Rule 1), using multiple brand names (Rule 2), mixing numbers with keywords (Rule 3), reorganizing and concatenating keywords (Rule 4), using IP addresses (Rule 5), and misplacing protocol or TLD strings within the URL (Rules 6 & 7).

The lexical features (Section 3.3.4) analyze string characteristics like entropy and mixed-case words, which are common in algorithmically generated or obfuscated URLs. The HTML features (Section 3.3.2) are designed to detect suspicious page structures used by attackers, such as deceptive link redirections, dead links (`javascript:void(0)`), links pointing to different domains, and links containing obfuscation symbols (`@`) or an unusual number of dots.\n\nWhile the method does not address dynamic evasions (like cloaking or deferred execution) or visual spoofing (image-based attacks), these are outside its defined modality of static URL and HTML analysis.

Thus, we design two adversaries in this experiment... First, we used the Dense Adversary Generation (DAG) attack [62] to generate adversarial attacks on the input screenshot...
