{"value":"Low","why":"KnowPhish and KPD operate as complex, multimodal black‐box pipelines (LLMs plus small‐LM classifiers plus logo/text matchers) without providing per‐decision explanations or exposing internal decision paths. The approach does not include any XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention/gradient heatmaps) or inherently interpretable structures whose reasoning is returned with each classification. Thus there is no mechanism for users or auditors to understand which features drove a specific phishing/benign decision.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 5 (Webpage Input → LLM summary → CRP classifier → Logo Matcher/Text Brand Extractor → Domain Check): no mention of per‐decision rationale or explainable outputs; Section 5.1: “The generated summary will serve as an auxiliary text attribute of the webpage for the following CRP classification and text brand extraction tasks.” (no user‐facing explanation)"}
