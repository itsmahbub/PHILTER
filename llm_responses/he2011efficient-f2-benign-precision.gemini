    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The evaluation addresses one of the two key diversity criteria: legitimate use of brand elements. Section 4.13 provides a detailed case study of a legitimate third-party website (Lanxtra.com) providing banking services for another entity (BVCU), which mimics the appearance and links of the primary brand and was even misclassified by other tools. This demonstrates a clear consideration for benign pages that are difficult to classify due to legitimate brand imitation. However, the paper does not meet the second criterion of including a diverse set of low-reputation or long-tail domains. The benign datasets described in Section 5 are composed of 'top targeted legitimate websites', 'Top pages according to Alexa', and 'Random pages' from a previous study. These sources predominantly represent popular, well-established sites rather than a dedicated set of low-reputation or long-tail domains. Since only one of the two criteria for a 'High' rating is fulfilled, the evaluation is rated as 'Medium'.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.13, \"Domain association\": \"Some legitimate websites may behave exactly like a phishing page. Let us see an example from Lanxtra.com page at http:// s28.lanxtra.com/internet/vlogin.html... The login page is not at the official Boulder Valley Credit Union (BVCU) website http:// bvcu.org/. However it has a BVCU logo, the design theme is exactly similar to the BVCU website, most of the anchors and requests point to the BVCU website as if this page wants to imitate the behavior of the BVCU website. Due to the close resemblance to phishing pages, even an experienced reviewer at the McAfee SiteAdvisor website marked Lanxtra.com as phishing.\"\n\nPage 8, Section 5.1, \"Experiment on the first dataset\": \"We collected 100 login pages of top targeted legitimate websites according to Millersmiles report. In addition, we also collected another 100 webpages which comprise of: • 35 Homepages of top targeted websites. • 35 Top pages according to Alexa. • 30 Random pages from a list of 500 pages used in 3Sharp’s phishing study (3Sharp, 2006).\""
