    "value": "High",
    "why": "The evaluation includes two large sets of benign URLs from Yahoo and DMOZ, which satisfy both criteria for diversity. \n\n(i) The DMOZ dataset, explicitly described as \"the world's largest directory community,\" is a comprehensive, human-edited directory. Its nature ensures the inclusion of a wide variety of long-tail and lower-reputation domains beyond just popular, high-ranking sites. \n\n(ii) The evaluation implicitly includes pages with legitimate brand element usage. The proposed heuristic rules are designed to detect 'phishing target words' (i.e., brand names) within URLs. The experimental results show that these rules generated false positives on benign URLs from the DMOZ/Yahoo datasets precisely because those legitimate URLs contained keywords of popular brands like \"google\", \"microsoft\", and \"apple\". This confirms that such challenging benign cases were present in the evaluation and tested against.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 4: \"We use a total of four datasets: the PhishTank blacklist (2776 unique domain URLs) maintained by Internet users, Yahoo datasets (5883 unique domain URLs), URLBlacklist (2216 unique domain URLs) collected by SquidGuard, and DMOZ (9509 unique domain URLs), the world’s largest directory community. PhishTank and URLBlacklist are phishing URL sets, and Yahoo and DMOZ are legal URL sets.\"\n\nPage 13, Section 4.2.2: \"The remaining false detections are found by Rule 4 because three URLs use google and microsoft keywords despite not being the official URLs of google or microsoft. The other URLs are misjudged because of the use of the high-frequency word “apple”."
