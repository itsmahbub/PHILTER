    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed SHLR method's first and most critical step for filtering legitimate pages involves sending the webpage's title tag content as a keyword query to an external, third-party search engine (Baidu). This action directly transmits potentially sensitive information about the user's browsing activity to an external server. Furthermore, the third stage of the method requires extracting features from DNS and Whois records, which necessitates external network queries that reveal the domain name being inspected. The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as hashing queries, sanitizing transmitted data, or other anonymization techniques. This transmission of unfiltered, identifiable data to external services for the purpose of detection classifies the method as having low privacy preservation.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"First, the title tag content of the webpage is input as search keywords to the Baidu search engine, and the webpage is considered legal if the webpage domain matches the domain name of any of the top-10 search results; otherwise, further evaluation is performed.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 3: \"Step 2. Use the content of the web's title tag as the search keywords in the Baidu search engine. The webpage is legal if the webpage domain matches the domain name of any of the top-10 search results.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 3: \"Step 6. Extract features from the URL's DNS, Whois, similarity with phishing vocabulary, lexical feature and HTML.\" (This step implies external queries for DNS and Whois information)."
