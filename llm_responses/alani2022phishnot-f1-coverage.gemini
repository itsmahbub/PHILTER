    "why": "The proposed method uses a set of 14 features extracted from the URL and related external sources. Several of these features are designed to capture a variety of URL-based phishing tactics. For example, 'qty_dot_domain' can help detect subdomain spoofing, while 'time_domain_activation' directly targets the tactic of using newly registered domains. The paper also explicitly discusses how features like 'directory_length' and 'qty_slash_directory' are indicative of structural obfuscation tactics used in phishing URLs. This demonstrates that the method inherently addresses multiple phishing tactics. However, the evaluation does not provide a breakdown of the dataset or performance results on a per-tactic basis. The phishing URLs from the datasets are treated as a single monolithic class, and performance is reported only in aggregate, preventing an understanding of the model's effectiveness against each specific tactic.",
    "evidence": "page 8, Section 6.2, \"The feature time_domain_activation, which is the number of days since the domain was registered, is a strong indicator of phishing domains, as most domains used in phishing are registered recently and do not stay registered for a long time. In most cases, these domain names get blocked, taken over by law enforcement, or blacklisted, so attackers regularly register new domains to use in phishing. The remaining three features usually have high values in phishing URLs. This includes the number of ‘/’ in the directory part of the URL (which indicates the use of many sub-directories, the length of the file name, and the length of the directory part.\"\n\npage 7, Table 3, \"Features resulting from feature-reduction phase.\": The table lists the 14 selected features, including 'qty_dot_domain', 'domain_length', 'directory_length', and 'time_domain_activation', which correspond to different URL-based attack tactics.\n\npage 4, Section 4, \"The dataset\": The paper describes the dataset sources (PhishTank and Alexa) but provides no analysis or breakdown of the phishing samples based on the tactics they employ (e.g., number of URLs with subdomain spoofing, newly registered domains, etc.). The results in Section 5 are presented as aggregate metrics without per-tactic performance."
