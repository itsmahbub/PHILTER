    "why": "The paper explicitly designs features to address a variety of phishing tactics, demonstrating a clear consideration for tactic diversity. The methodology includes features to detect URL obfuscation techniques such as subdomain spoofing (UF1: Dots in Hostname), use of IP addresses (UF4), and lengthy URLs (UF3). It also addresses HTTPS misuse (UF5) by not treating HTTPS as a definitive sign of legitimacy. Furthermore, the method incorporates features to counter specific content-based tactics, most notably 'Image-based Phishing' where attackers replace a site's content with a single background image (HF7). The paper acknowledges the tactic of using compromised domains, although its features for domain age (TF1) are vulnerable to it. While the method addresses multiple tactics in its design, the evaluation does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the dataset by tactic, nor does it report detection performance for each specific tactic. It reports overall performance on a general dataset from PhishTank.",
