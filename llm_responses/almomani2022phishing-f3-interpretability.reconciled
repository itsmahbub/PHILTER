{"value":"Medium","why":"While the authors do not provide any per‐decision explanations (e.g., SHAP, LIME, decision paths), they do employ Information Gain attribute evaluation to rank and select features, offering a global view of which inputs are most significant. This satisfies the ‘Medium’ level of interpretability—global or limited insight into the model—without tracing individual predictions.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 3.1 Pre-Processing and Features Extraction: “There are several methods of feature selection and in this paper, we have used Information Gain Attribute Evaluation to select the best features from the dataset. By measuring the information gap calculated for the target class, this method measures the significance of the attribute.”"}
