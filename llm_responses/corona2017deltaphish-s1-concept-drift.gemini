    "why": "The method is designed around an inherently stable principle that is resistant to concept drift. It detects phishing by comparing a suspicious page to the homepage of the compromised website where it is hosted. The core idea is that a phishing page (impersonating, e.g., a bank) will always be structurally and visually dissimilar to the legitimate pages of its host (e.g., a small business website). This fundamental signal of 'dissimilarity' is robust to evolving attacker tactics that change URL structures or specific HTML content, as the core deception strategy remains the same.\n\nHowever, the paper does not propose any explicit adaptive strategies like online learning or periodic retraining to handle model decay. More importantly, the evaluation protocol does not test for resilience to concept drift. The dataset was collected over a relatively short four-month period and evaluated using random 60/40 splits, not a time-ordered split (e.g., training on older data and testing on newer data). Therefore, while the design is inherently robust to drift, this property is not empirically validated in the paper.",
    "evidence": "Page 3, Section 1: \"The key idea behind our approach, named DeltaPhish (or δPhish, for short), is to compare the HTML code and the visual appearance of potential phishing pages against the corresponding characteristics of the homepage of the compromised (hosting) website (Sect. 3). In fact, phishing pages normally exhibit a much significant difference in terms of aspect and structure with respect to the website homepage than the other legitimate pages of the website.\"\n\nPage 12, Section 4.1: \"Our dataset has been collected from October 2015 to January 2016, starting from active phishing URLs obtained online from the PhishTank feed.\"\n\nPage 12, Section 4.1: \"In these experiments, we consider 20 distinct training-test pairs to average our results. For a fair evaluation, webpages collected from the same domain (i.e., belonging to the same family) are included either in the training data or in the test data. In each repetition, we randomly select 60% of the families for training, while the remaining 40% are used for testing.\""
