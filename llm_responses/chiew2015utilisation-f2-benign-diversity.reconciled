{"value":"High","why":"The paper’s evaluation includes both required dimensions of benign-page diversity. First, it explicitly tests on low‐reputation “long‐tail” domains via Dataset 3 (500 “unpopular legitimate webpages” ranked Alexa 1001–5150 and harvested from dmoz.org/botw.org). Second, it demonstrates and qualitatively evaluates pages embedding legitimate third‐party brand elements (OAuth/social‐login widgets and multiple logos), showing the detector correctly handles such cases that typically trip up purely textual approaches.","evidence":"Page 7, Section 3.3: “We also constructed an additional dataset 3, which consists of 500 other unpopular legitimate webpages… They are ranked between 1001 to 5150 in Alexa and 16.4 percent… not ranked in the Alexa top one million.”\nPage 10, Section 4: “It is also noteworthy to mention that our proposed method is capable of handling a webpage with multiple logos… For instance, some websites allow users to login with multiple social network IDs as shown in Fig. 6.”"}
