{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates its phishing detection solely on clean, static datasets without testing against any active evasion or adversarial manipulations (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, cloaking, deferred execution). There is no methodology or experimental section addressing robustness to active attacks within its claimed URL/content-based scope.","evidence":"Page 11, Section 4.1: “This experiment was conducted using … two classes training and testing based on the 10-fold cross-validation … The result was built based on 70% training and testing.” No mention of any active or evasive attack testing."}
