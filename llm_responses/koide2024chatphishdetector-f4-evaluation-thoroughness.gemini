    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the proposed method by reporting metrics well-suited for the class-imbalanced nature of phishing detection. The authors report the key class-sensitive metrics of Precision, Recall, and F-measure (F1-score), which are crucial for understanding the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, they include a summary metric, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), to evaluate the model's overall classification quality across different thresholds. This combination of metrics fulfills all criteria for a high-quality evaluation.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section V-B, PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: \"Precision (= TP/(TP+FP)), Recall (= TP/(TP+FN)), Accuracy (= (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)), and F-measure (= 2 × (Precision × Recall)/(Precision+Recall)) were used as performance metrics. Table 2 shows the detailed detection results of ChatPhishDetector for each mode and model.\"\n\nPage 8, Table 1: This table, titled \"Comparison of performance metrics,\" presents results using columns for \"Precision,\" \"Recall,\" \"Accuracy,\" and \"F-measure.\"\n\nPage 9, Figure 5: This figure is titled \"ROC Curve for phishing classification based on phishing_score.\" The plot legend explicitly reports AUC values for each model, such as \"GPT-4V (AUC = 0.998)\"."
