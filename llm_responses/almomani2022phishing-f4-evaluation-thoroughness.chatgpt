{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper’s evaluation reports class-sensitive metrics (precision and recall) and includes a summary metric (AUC, via ROC curves) but omits the F1-score, thus lacking full metric coverage required under class imbalance.","evidence":"Table 4 (page 13): columns “MLA Precision”, “MLA Recall”, and “MLA AUC”; Figure 7 (page 14): “ROC Curve comparison”; Conclusion (page 18): “we proposed accuracy, recall and AUC measures” (no F1-score reported)."}
