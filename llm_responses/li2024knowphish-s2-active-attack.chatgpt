{"value":"Medium","why":"The authors evaluate robustness only against a limited set of HTML-level evasions (typosquatting, prompt injection, text-to-image) and propose defenses for these, but do not evaluate other active attacks (e.g. adversarial image perturbations, junk HTML/JS, invisible elements or dynamic content loading) within their static scope. Thus they demonstrate partial robustness but not across the full attack surface.","evidence":"Section 6.5 ‘We study the robustness of our text-based components against three types of evasion techniques in HTML…’, Table 4 (brand extraction and CRP results under typosquatting, prompt injection and text-to-image attacks)"}
