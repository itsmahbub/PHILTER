{"value":"High","why":"DynaPhish explicitly implements an adaptive, continual‐learning strategy via its Brand Knowledge Expansion module, which dynamically augments the reference list at runtime, and it is evaluated in a time‐forward deployment scenario over fresh, unseen phishing webpages. This meets both criteria for “High” adaptation to concept drift: (1) it employs an adaptive strategy to combat evolving phishing tactics, and (2) its evaluation protocol uses data drawn from later time periods (a one‐month wild‐study on newly issued TLS domains) rather than the same historical dataset used for development.","evidence":"• Section 3.2 (Brand Knowledge Expansion): “Given a new webpage w, the Brand Knowledge Expansion module … actively expands a dynamic reference list.”\n• Section 10.1 (Wild‐study Setup, page 14): “We control the experiment to crawl 3K randomly fresh websites per day … from 2022-09-02 to 2022-10-04.”\n• Section 5.2 (Table 6, page 12): shows DynaPhish boosting recall by 10× over state‐of‐the‐art detectors on these fresh, time‐forward webpages."}
