    "why": "The paper exclusively focuses on the design and offline evaluation of a neural network model for phishing detection. It does not provide any details about the system's deployment architecture or how user data would be handled during real-time inference. The model relies on 30 features extracted from URLs, HTML, and JavaScript content, which are privacy-sensitive. Since the paper makes no mention of client-side feature extraction, local inference, or any other privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., hashed lookups, federated learning), the method falls into the category where no inference-time data-handling details are given. According to the codebook, this absence of information defaults to a \"Low\" rating, as it implies that sensitive user data (like full URLs or page content) would need to be sent to an external server for analysis.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.1, System architecture: \"The overall layout of detection phishing is shown in Fig. 1. First, we build a phishing detection model based on our novel neural network through training dataset. Next, for the detection of an unknown website, the features are exacted first, and then put the feature into detection model to evaluate the benign or the phishing website.\" This describes the detection process abstractly, without specifying whether feature extraction and model inference occur on the client's device or on a remote server. The entire paper lacks discussion of a deployment model, leaving the handling of user data during inference unspecified."
