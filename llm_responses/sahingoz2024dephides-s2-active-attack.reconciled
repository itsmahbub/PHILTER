{"value":"Low","why":"The paper provides no empirical evaluation against any active evasion techniques within its URL-only scope. All experiments are conducted on clean phishing and benign URL datasets without testing obfuscated, shortened, redirected, or adversarially manipulated URLs. Although the authors claim character-level models can resist simple lexical obfuscations, they offer no demonstration or benchmark against such attacks, and explicitly acknowledge limitations (e.g. cannot detect URL hijacking).","evidence":"Section IV.A (Dataset Collection): only PhishTank and Common Crawl URLs are used for training and testing\nSection V (Experimental Results): all metrics reported on clean train/validation/test splits with no adversarial or evasive-case evaluation\nSection V.C (Overview of Tested Algorithms): “the proposed system cannot detect URL hijacking attacks due to its structure”"}
