{"value": "Low", "why": "The paper does not evaluate the proposed detection method against any deliberate evasive or adversarial manipulations within its input modality. All experiments are conducted on unaltered phishing and benign pages, with no testing of obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, deferred execution, cloaking, or other active‐attack techniques.", "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.2: “The set of phishing web pages originate from 100,000 URLs … The remaining pages were randomly sampled to construct a phishing dataset of 1,000 entries.”; Page 8, Section 4.3: “To assess the performance of target identification, we used the datasets presented in Section 4.2.”  No experiments involving adversarial or evasive manipulations are described anywhere in the evaluation."}
