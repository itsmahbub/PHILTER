{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper evaluates robustness only against two types of adversarial perturbations (webpage source manipulations and logo‐noise attacks) observable in screenshots, without assessing other active evasions (e.g. dynamic content loading, cloaking, HTML obfuscation) within its claimed multimodal scope. Thus it shows partial but not comprehensive resistance to active attacks.","evidence":"Abstract (p.1): “robustness against two known adversarial attacks.”; Section VII (p.11) and Table IV: evaluation results for webpage source perturbation and noise on logo attacks only."}
