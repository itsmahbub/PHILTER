{"value":"Medium","why":"VisualPhishNet employs a tactic-agnostic, visual‐similarity design that can detect phishing regardless of hosting environment or URL manipulation. However, the authors do not categorize their evaluation dataset by phishing tactic nor report detection performance per tactic.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 6.7 (“Robustness and Security Evaluation”): “We studied 7 types of perturbations… we applied to the phishing test set… ”; Page 7, Section 7 (“Discussion”): no per‐tactic breakdown is provided, only overall matching accuracy and ROC scores."}
