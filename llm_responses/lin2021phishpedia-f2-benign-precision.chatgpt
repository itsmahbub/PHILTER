{"value": "Low", "why": "The evaluation of Phishpedia’s false positive rate uses only ∼30K benign webpages drawn from Alexa’s top-ranked domains, without inclusion of low-reputation (long-tail or recently registered) sites or benign pages legitimately embedding brand elements. This limited benign dataset risks underestimating false positives on more diverse ‘hard’ cases.", "evidence": "Page 3800, Section 5.1: “Benign Webpage Dataset. We collected 29,951 benign webpages from the top-ranked Alexa list [1] for this experiment.”"}
