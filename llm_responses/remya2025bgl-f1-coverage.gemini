    "why": "The proposed method, BGL-PhishNet, is explicitly designed to address multiple phishing tactics by integrating three distinct models, each targeting a different feature category. BERT handles lexical and semantic features ('suspicious keywords'), GNN analyzes structural features ('complex subdomains'), and LightGBM processes metadata features ('domain age', 'SSL presence'). This multi-faceted approach inherently covers a diversity of tactics observable in URLs and their associated metadata, such as lexical manipulation, subdomain spoofing, and the use of newly registered domains or improper SSL certificates. However, the evaluation lacks a per-tactic performance analysis. The paper reports aggregate performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) but does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation dataset by the types of phishing tactics present, nor does it report how well the model performs against each specific tactic.",
    "evidence": "Page 7-8, Section VII. HYBRID MODEL: The paper describes how each component targets different tactics:\n- BERT (VII.A): 'BERT is a transformer-based language model designed for analyzing textual data... to learn linguistic patterns indicative of phishing attempts. Phishing URLs often include misleading text, such as embedded keywords (e.g., login, secure, or update)...'\n- GNN (VII.B): 'Phishing URLs often employ deceptive structural features, such as complex subdomains or mimicry of URL architectures of legitimate websites. To analyze these structural patterns, GNN model each URL as a graph.'\n- LightGBM (VII.C): '...excels in processing structured metadata... Phishing websites often exhibit metadata patterns that distinguish them from legitimate websites, such as shorter domain registration durations, lack of SSL certificates, or irregular WHOIS data...'\n\nHowever, the evaluation section (Page 16, Table 4 & 6) presents only aggregate performance metrics for the hybrid model and its components, without any breakdown of performance against specific tactics."
