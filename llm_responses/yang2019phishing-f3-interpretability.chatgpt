{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method uses CNN-LSTM and XGBoost classifiers but provides no per-decision or global explanations of model outputs. The paper does not include any XAI techniques (e.g. SHAP, LIME, attention or gradient‐based heatmaps), nor does it report feature importances or decision paths, thus functioning as a pure black box.","evidence":"Page 5–6, Section IV.A and IV.B: description of CNN-LSTM and multidimensional XGBoost classification, with no mention of any interpretability or explanation mechanism"}
