{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics—precision, recall and F1-score—as well as false-positive and false-negative rates, but does not include any of the required summary metrics (AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC or MCC) needed to assess performance under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 1516, Section V (Evaluation Results): “Evaluate whether a machine learning model has high performance, standard statistical metrics with accuracy, recall, and precision… we use accuracy, F1, false-positive rate, false-negative rate to measure the efficiency of models.” No AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC or MCC is reported."}
