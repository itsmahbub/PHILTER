{"value":"Low","why":"The paper describes a centrally trained deep-learning model that operates on full raw URLs (including path and query components) and makes no mention of any client-side or in-boundary deployment, nor of any privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g. hashed lookups, federated learning, URL sanitization). As a result, inference would require sending full URLs off-device to an external classifier, offering no privacy safeguards.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (Data preprocessing), p. 9: “The https:// and http:// components of the URLs were eliminated. … All URLs in the data set include the ‘https://’ or ‘http://’ prefixes. As it is present in all URL addresses, it is not a distinctive element and has been removed.”  No further discussion of deployment or privacy handling is provided."}
