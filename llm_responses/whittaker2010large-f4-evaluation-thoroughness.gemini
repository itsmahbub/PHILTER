    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation that is highly appropriate for the class-imbalanced problem of phishing detection. The authors explicitly report key class-sensitive metrics, including Precision and Recall (also referred to as True Positive Rate), and provide the full confusion matrix components (True Positives, False Positives, False Negatives, True Negatives). Furthermore, the evaluation includes Precision-Recall curves, which serve as a graphical summary metric visualizing the trade-off between precision and recall across various thresholds. This directly addresses the need for a summary metric like AUC-PRC that is robust to class imbalance.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Table 9: This table explicitly lists performance metrics for a classification threshold of 0.5, including 'True Positive Rate/Recall' and 'Precision'. For the validation dataset ('Candidate on August Data'), the paper reports a Recall of 0.9185 and a Precision of 0.9895.\n\nPage 11, Figure 4: The paper presents 'Precision-recall curves for classifier trained on data collected Apr 16–Jul 14.' This figure serves as a summary metric, illustrating the model's performance across all decision thresholds.\n\nPage 10, Section 4.3, Classifier Performance: The text describes the methodology for generating the curves: 'To generate these curves, we first calculate the classification scores using the trained models. Next, as we vary a threshold from 0.01 to 0.99, we determine the precision and recall obtained by classifying pages with a score greater than that threshold as phishing pages.'"
