{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method assumes a static distribution and does not address concept drift: it relies solely on URL character features (which are volatile), does not include any adaptive or continual learning strategy, and its evaluation randomly splits data from the same April–July 2018 period rather than using an earlier-to-later temporal partition. There is no evidence of time-aware testing or retraining to ensure robustness against evolving phishing tactics.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 5.1 (“We collect 68030 legitimate URLs … and 12003 phishing URLs … from April 2018 to July 2018. We randomly extract 4000 … for the test dataset. Hence, we can use the left 64030 … and 8003 … for training.”)"}
