{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed method includes explicit defenses against common HTML‐level obfuscation attacks within its static input modality—e.g. features to detect hidden or disabled elements (display:none, visibility:hidden, hidden inputs), empty links, and typosquatted brand names via Levenshtein distance—fulfilling at least one category of manipulation/evasion defense. However, the paper does not evaluate robustness on adversarially crafted or evasion‐focused datasets, nor does it provide a quantitative breakdown of attack coverage by evasion tactic, precluding a “High” rating.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 3.1.2, feature (7) Hidden/Restricted information:  “Some special codes in HTML codes can prevent the content from displaying or restricting the function of a tag… <div style=‘visibility:hidden’> or <div style=‘display:none’> … <input type=‘hidden’> hides the input box…”\nPage 3, Section 3.1.1, feature (8) Similar target brands: “we calculate the Levenshtein distance between each string and a given target brand… to discover typosquatting behavior.”\nSection 4 (Experiments): evaluation is only on real‐world PhishTank/Alexa datasets with no adversarial/evasion‐focused testing or quantitative breakdown of evasive tactics."}
