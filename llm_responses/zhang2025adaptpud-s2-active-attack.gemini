    "why": "The paper's central theme is the detection of \"tailored deceptive P-URLs,\" which are URLs actively crafted to evade detectors. The evaluation section provides strong, direct evidence of the method's resistance to a diverse set of such attacks relevant to the URL modality. In a practical application test, the authors evaluated their model against 20 fresh, real-world \"tailored deceptive P-URLs\" that employed various evasion techniques. These techniques included abusing legitimate cloud platforms (e.g., github.io, webflow.io), using URL shorteners (t.ly, qrco.de), creating look-alike domains through typosquatting, and using semantic obfuscation via non-standard domain names (Pinyin). The proposed AdaptPUD method successfully detected 100% of these evasive URLs, significantly outperforming all baseline models, some of which failed completely. This demonstrates robustness against a diverse set of active attacks observable within its input modality.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 5.4, \"Practical application\": \"The well-trained models are deployed to detect active phishing sites in real-world applications. In January 2025, we collected 30 active P-URLs from PhishTank, categorizing them into two groups: general P-URLs and tailored deceptive P-URLs... AdaptPUD performs exceptionally well across both categories, with 100% detection accuracy. The other baselines perform poorly, especially for tailored deceptive P-URLs.\" \n\nThe paper then details the specific attack vectors observed:\n- Page 10, Section 5.4: \"Abuse of cloud-based platforms. ...attackers often design deceptive subdomains and host them on cloud-based legitimate domains (such as Weebly, Webflow, GitHub, and GitBook)... Additionally, short link services such as qrco.de and t.ly are commonly abused...\"\n- Page 10, Section 5.4: \"Look-alike domains. Attackers frequently use typosquatting to create look-alike domains...\"\n- Page 10, Section 5.4: \"Specific use of Pinyin domains. Another interesting finding is the use of Pinyin domains...\"\n\nPage 11, Table 7, provides the quantitative results, showing AdaptPUD (AP) correctly classifying all 20 tailored P-URLs, while the next best baseline (TU) only classified 6."
