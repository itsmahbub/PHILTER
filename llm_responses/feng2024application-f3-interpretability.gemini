    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method is a feedforward neural network, which is inherently a non-interpretable or \"black box\" model. The paper's novelty and focus are on the training methodology (Monte Carlo algorithm) and hyperparameter optimization (design risk minimization) to improve accuracy and stability. The authors do not implement or discuss any techniques to provide interpretability for the model's predictions. There is no mention of post hoc explanation methods (like SHAP or LIME), analysis of feature importance or contribution, or any mechanism to trace or understand why a specific website was classified as phishing. The evaluation is based entirely on performance metrics, confirming that the model's reasoning process remains opaque.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.2, The structure of the novel neural network: \"As shown in Fig. 2, the structure of the novel neural network is made up of three layers: input layer, hidden layer and output layer. However, this novel neural network is different from the traditional neural network that introduces the principle of design risk minimization and Monte carlo (MC) algorithm.\" This establishes the model as a standard neural network architecture, which is not inherently interpretable. The subsequent sections on design and training focus on optimizing weights and parameters to minimize a cost function, without addressing explainability."
