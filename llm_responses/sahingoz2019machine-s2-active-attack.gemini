    "why": "The paper proposes a method with several components specifically designed to counter a subset of active, URL-based attacks. The \"Maliciousness Analysis Module\" explicitly targets typosquatting by calculating Levenshtein distance to known brand and keywords. The \"Random Word Detection Module\" uses a Markov Chain model to identify randomly generated strings, a common tactic for creating evasive subdomains. The feature set also includes a check for Punycode, which is used in IDN homograph attacks. These design choices show clear consideration for resisting specific, common manipulation techniques. However, the evaluation is not a comprehensive stress test against a diverse or adversarial set of attacks. While the PhishTank dataset used is from the wild and likely contains such examples, the paper does not systematically report on the system's performance against different classes of evasion. The robustness is implied by the system's design and overall accuracy, rather than being explicitly demonstrated against a broad and challenging attack surface. Therefore, it demonstrates partial robustness but not across the full potential attack surface for its modality.",
