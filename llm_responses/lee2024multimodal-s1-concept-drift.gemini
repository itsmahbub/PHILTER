    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's proposed method is designed to be robust against concept drift by relying on an LLM's pre-trained, general knowledge of stable brand identity (logos, themes, etc.) rather than volatile, easily changed features. The authors explicitly position this as an advantage over traditional models that require continuous retraining to adapt to evolving attacker tactics. This design choice fulfills one part of the metric's criteria. However, the evaluation protocol does not validate this claimed robustness in a temporally meaningful way. The dataset was collected over a single, contiguous three-month period, and the experiments do not use a time-aware train-test split (e.g., training on older data and testing on newer data). The paper also acknowledges a potential weakness related to concept drift, noting that an LLM's knowledge is static up to its training cut-off and may not be aware of the latest brands. Since the method is designed to handle drift but is not evaluated against it temporally, it meets the criteria for a 'Medium' rating.",
