    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation includes a robust and diverse set of benign webpages, satisfying both criteria for a 'High' rating.\n\n1.  **Low-reputation / long-tail domains:** The evaluation explicitly incorporates two challenging subsets of benign domains. First, it uses a 'Low-ranked Alexa websites' dataset (ranks 100k-105k) to specifically assess brand recognition performance on less popular sites. Second, a large-scale field study is conducted on 90,000 websites from 'CertStream Service', which consists of domains with newly issued TLS certificates. This set is representative of emerging, long-tail, and low-reputation domains that are difficult to classify.\n\n2.  **Legitimate brand element usage:** The methodology is designed to handle benign pages that use third-party brand elements, such as Single Sign-On (SSO) widgets. The paper describes a specific 'SSO Domain Redirection' mechanism to correctly process logins via Google or Microsoft without generating false positives. The main benchmark evaluation uses 6,075 benign websites crawled from the Alexa Top 5,000 to 15,000, a set that naturally includes countless instances of legitimate embedded brand elements (e.g., social media icons, SSO buttons), thereby testing the effectiveness of this mechanism.",
    "evidence": "For low-reputation domains:\n- Page 8, Section 4.1.3: \"Low-ranked Alexa websites. We crawled the lower-ranked (rank from 100k to 105k) Alexa websites and were left with 2,964 alive and accessible sites. This dataset is used in RQ2 to assess the brand recognition rate for less popular brands.\"\n- Page 8, Section 4.1.3: \"Field Study Evaluation: CertStream Service. We crawl websites from Certstream feeds, which offer domains with newly issued or updated TLS certificates. We crawled 3,000 emerging websites daily from CertStream [1], and the crawling lasted for 30 days, yielding a total of 90,000 websites.\"\n\nFor legitimate brand element usage:\n- Page 6, Section 3.1.4: \"SSO Domain Redirection Single Sign-On (SSO) services often redirect users to third-party sites (e.g., Google or Microsoft) for login. When a redirection happens, we will re-run PhishLLM on the updated URL and screenshot...This prevents potential false positives.\"\n- Page 8, Section 4.1.3: \"Phishing Detection Benchmark...We collected a comparable number of benign websites (6,075) by crawling from the Alexa Top 5,000 to 15,000 websites. These datasets were employed in RQ1 to evaluate the overall classification performance...\""
