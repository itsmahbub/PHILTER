    "why": "The paper explicitly designs its method, SHLR, to be resilient against active attacks, with a primary focus on URL obfuscation, which is a common evasion tactic. The authors identify this as a key challenge and dedicate a significant portion of their methodology to addressing it. \n\nThe method's resistance is demonstrated through a multi-layered approach:\n1.  **Heuristic Rules:** The core of the method's resistance lies in the seven heuristic rules (Section 3.2), which are specifically crafted to detect various URL obfuscation techniques. These include hiding target brand names in the URL path (Rule 1), using multiple brand names (Rule 2), mixing numbers with keywords (Rule 3), reorganizing and concatenating keywords (Rule 4), using IP addresses (Rule 5), and misplacing protocol or TLD strings within the URL (Rules 6 & 7). This demonstrates a direct and robust defense against a diverse set of lexical attacks.\n2.  **Machine Learning Features:** The Logistic Regression component incorporates a wide array of features designed to capture signals of evasion. The lexical features (Section 3.3.4) analyze string characteristics like entropy and mixed-case words, which are common in algorithmically generated or obfuscated URLs. The HTML features (Section 3.3.2) are designed to detect suspicious page structures used by attackers, such as deceptive link redirections, dead links (`javascript:void(0)`), links pointing to different domains, and links containing obfuscation symbols (`@`) or an unusual number of dots.\n\nWhile the method does not address dynamic evasions (like cloaking or deferred execution) or visual spoofing (image-based attacks), these are outside its defined modality of static URL and HTML analysis. Within its scope, the paper demonstrates a comprehensive and multi-faceted defense against a diverse set of relevant active attacks.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 1.3, Challenge: \"First, URL obfuscation is one common escape tactic used by phishing attackers (Lin et al., 2015). URL obfuscation refers to technical methods of including junk characters in the URL, changing the encoding method, using the IP address instead of the domain name, randomly generating the domain name, etc (Sha et al., 2016). Various URL obfuscation techniques are used to change and eliminate the original features of phishing URLs and evade the detection of anti-phishing tools.\"\n\nPage 4, Main Contributions: \"2. Seven heuristic rules are proposed for detecting URL obfuscation technology, which can quickly identify phishing websites.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 3.2, Heuristic rule-based detection phase: \"Pattern matching through strings can detect URL obfuscation techniques, such as URL naming standard violations and hidden phishing target words... We propose Rules 1 and 2 based on this phenomenon... The method of using numbers, delimiters, and concatenated strings to forge an identification name is a common obfuscation technique used by attackers... Thus, we propose Rule 4, which is a URL word reorganization method to detect more complicated obfuscation technology.\"\n\nPage 9, Section 3.3.2, HTML: \"Link redirection is commonly used by attackers. Therefore, we calculate the number of <meta http-equiv=\"re fresh\" content= \"...\" > type tags in the webpage... The attribute href = javascript:void(0) indicates a dead link, which means that clicking on the link does nothing. Standard does not recommend this method of use. The extraction formula of this feature is as follows:\"\n"
