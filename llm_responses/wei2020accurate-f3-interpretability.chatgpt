The paper does not expose feature importances, decision paths, attention weights, or employ any XAI techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP, gradient‐based heatmaps) to justify individual classification decisions.", "evidence": "Page 2 (Fig. 1 caption): “We do not use any hand‐crafted features...”; Sections 4.2–4.3: description of one‐hot encoding and CNN architecture with no mention of interpretability or explanation methods."}
