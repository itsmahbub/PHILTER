    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper satisfies both criteria for a 'High' rating. First, the proposed method, DynaPhish, is explicitly designed as an adaptive strategy to combat concept drift, which it identifies as a key limitation of existing reference-based detectors. The core 'Brand Knowledge Expansion' component dynamically discovers and adds new brands to its reference list at runtime, while a 'Maintenance' algorithm periodically re-validates existing references to handle updates or obsolescence. This directly addresses the problem of the static reference list becoming outdated as phishing campaigns evolve. Second, the evaluation protocol includes a rigorous temporal study. The 'Effectiveness in the Wild' experiment (RQ5) simulates a time-forward deployment by testing the system on a stream of 99,000 fresh websites collected over a one-month period, starting with an older, static reference list. The paper even analyzes the changing nature of phishing targets over this period, directly demonstrating and evaluating its resilience to concept drift.",

DynaPhish assumes a runtime deployment scenario and (1) actively expands a dynamic reference list, and (2) supports the detection of brandless webpages with convincing counterfactual explanations."
