    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation that meets all the criteria for a high rating. It explicitly reports the required class-sensitive metrics—Precision, Recall, and F1-score—for the four machine learning models it evaluates. Additionally, it reports a required summary metric, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), for each classifier. The authors also define these metrics clearly in a dedicated table and provide visualizations of both the ROC curve and the Precision-Recall curve, demonstrating a thorough approach to performance evaluation.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Table 2, \"Results from different classifiers\": This table presents columns for \"Precision (%)\", \"Recall (%)\", and \"F1 score (%)\" for Random forest, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Support vector machine, and Logistic regression classifiers.\nPage 8, Table 5, \"AUC scores of different classifiers\": This table explicitly lists the \"AUC score\" for each of the four classifiers, with Random forest achieving 0.9967. The text also states: \"Fig. 6 presents the ROC curve of different classifiers...Table 5 shows the AUC score of different classifiers.\""
