{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper evaluates its phishing detection only against two types of adversarial perturbations on webpage screenshots—semantic/content-level source manipulations and logo‐noise attacks—without testing other active evasions (e.g. dynamic content loading, cloaking, HTML/JavaScript obfuscation) despite claiming a multimodal (screenshot + HTML) scope. This constitutes partial robustness within the screenshot modality, meeting ‘Medium’ but not ‘High’ criteria.","evidence":"Page 11, Section VII and Table IV: only “Adversarial Attack 1—Webpage source perturbation” and “Adversarial Attack 2—Noise perturbation on Logo” are evaluated; no other evasive techniques are tested."}
