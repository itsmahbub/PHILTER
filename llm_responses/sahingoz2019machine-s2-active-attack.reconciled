{"value":"Medium","why":"The system includes explicit defenses against a subset of URL-based active evasion techniques—typosquatting (via Levenshtein‐distance checks in the Maliciousness Analysis Module), randomly generated subdomain detection (via the Markov‐chain Random Word Detection Module), and Punycode homograph checks—demonstrating partial robustness within its URL modality. However, its evaluation is limited to overall accuracy on a mixed phishing/benign dataset and does not include systematic adversarial stress tests across the full range of URL‐level evasions (e.g., obfuscated encodings, crafted adversarial perturbations), so it does not cover the entire attack surface.","evidence":"page 7, section 4.5: “...we have implemented a Maliciousness Analysis Module (MAM), which mainly focuses on detection of Typosquatting...”; page 7, section 4.4: “...we implemented the Random Word Detection Module (RWDM)...to detect the number of words in the URL which are created with random characters.”; page 10, Table 2: “Puny Code is a standard that allows the browser to decode certain special characters in the address field. Attackers may use Puny Code to avoid detecting malicious URLs.”"}
