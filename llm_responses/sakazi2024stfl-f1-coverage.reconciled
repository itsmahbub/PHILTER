{"value":"Medium","why":"Although the paper does not report any per-tactic breakdown of phishing tactics in its evaluation, the URL-based Bi-LSTM autoencoder is inherently tactic-agnostic and thus capable of detecting a variety of URL-level evasion strategies (e.g. lexical manipulations, subdomain spoofing) without being explicitly programmed for each one. It therefore addresses multiple phishing tactics by design but falls short of a High rating due to the lack of any quantitative, per-tactic performance analysis.","evidence":"Page 3, Section IV: “By using a Bi-LSTM in the autoencoder, the autoencoder can capture the lexical dependencies between the characters from left-to-right and right-to-left… We divide the URL into three parts … domain and TLD, sub-domain, and the path… to obtain as much information as possible from each part.”\nPage 5, Section V.A (Datasets): Describes only aggregate phishing vs. benign URL counts for CPURNN, PDRCNN, and Khramtsova et al. datasets, with no annotation or breakdown by specific phishing tactics."}
