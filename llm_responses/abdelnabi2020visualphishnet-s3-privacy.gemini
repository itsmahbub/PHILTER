    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method, VisualPhishNet, relies on taking a screenshot of the user's current webpage, processing it through a CNN to generate an embedding vector, and comparing this vector to a pre-computed database of embeddings from trusted websites. The paper discusses computational performance and storage requirements in a \"Deployment Considerations\" section but completely omits any discussion of privacy. Transmitting a full screenshot of a user's browser window to a remote server for analysis is a significant privacy risk, as the page could contain personal information, session details, or other sensitive data. The paper does not mention any client-side deployment (e.g., in a browser extension) that would keep the screenshot on the user's device. It also fails to describe any privacy-preserving mechanisms like hashing, anonymized feature vectors, or federated learning. According to the codebook, a \"Low\" rating is assigned when screenshots are sent to an external server, or when \"no inference-time data-handling details are given.\" This paper falls into the latter category as it does not address the critical privacy implications of its data requirements.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 7.3, Deployment Considerations. The entire section discusses practical aspects like storage and computation speed but never mentions privacy. The text states: \"On a typical computer with 8 GByte RAM and Intel Core I7-8565U 1.80GHz processor, the average time for prediction is 1.18±1.5 sec. on a single thread, which dropped to 0.45±0.58 seconds on a NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU.\" The mention of a server-grade GPU (Tesla P100) suggests a server-side deployment model is a likely consideration, which would require the client to send the screenshot to the server. However, the paper provides no details on this data transmission or any safeguards, leaving a critical privacy gap in the proposed system's evaluation."
