{"value":"Low","why":"The PhiUSIIL framework does not include any mechanism—neither inherently transparent models nor post-hoc XAI techniques—to provide per-decision explanations or expose decision paths. While feature selection (via RandomForest, XGBoost, mutual information) is used during development, no global or per-instance feature importance is reported at prediction time, and no attention, gradient, or bounding-box explanations are provided.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 4.2.1: “We implemented RandomForestClassifier, Decision-TreeClassifier, LGBMClassifier, and XGBClassifier to find the importance of each feature… The top 85% of features are selected based on their higher Mutual_info_classif value.”  No further mention of feature importance or explanation in the deployed model."}
