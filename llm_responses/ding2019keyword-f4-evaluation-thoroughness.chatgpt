{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics—precision, recall, and F1-score—for its detection method (e.g. “accuracy of 98.9%, recall rate of 99.1%, F-Score of 99% and precision of 98.9%”), but does not report any summary metric such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC, which are required for a ‘High’ Evaluation Quality rating under class imbalance.","evidence":"Section 4.2 (Experiment 4), Table 15: “SHLR … achieves an accuracy of 98.9%, a recall rate of 99.1%, an F-Score of 99% and precision of 98.9%.” No AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC is reported."}
