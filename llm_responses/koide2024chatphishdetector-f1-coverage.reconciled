{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper demonstrates the ability to detect a wide range of phishing tactics—social engineering techniques, brand impersonation, domain squatting, non-visual clones, etc.—through a tactic-agnostic LLM design and a diverse dataset. However, it does not provide a full quantitative breakdown of evaluation performance for each tactic category; it only reports overall metrics and a single subset (“172 non-clone” sites). Therefore it meets the Medium criterion.","evidence":"Section V-G (Evidence for Identifying Phishing Sites) lists seven specific tactic categories addressed by the system. Section V-B reports overall Precision/Recall/Accuracy (Table 1) and a performance result for a single tactic subset (‘172 phishing sites that did not closely resemble their legitimate sites’), but no per-tactic performance breakdown for each tactic category."}
