{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any on-device inference or privacy safeguards. The method requires transmitting full URLs (including path and parameters) to an external system for classification, with no mention of hashing, sanitization, or federated learning. There is no discussion of running the detector locally in the browser or app to avoid sending sensitive data off-device.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 4.3 (“Sequence diagram of the proposed method. Upon the HTTP request from the client, the system checks the URL and decides if it can be requested.”); Page 5, Section 4.2 (encoding the entire URL text without stripping query parameters)"}
