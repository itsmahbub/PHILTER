    "why": "The paper demonstrates robustness against a subset of active attacks, primarily those involving content manipulation. The core design of the first-level filter uses fuzzy hashing (Simhash and Perceptual Hash) explicitly to be resilient to minor modifications, making it effective against near-duplicate sites where attackers misspell text, change tags, or alter paths. The method also directly counters the common evasion technique of replacing text with images by incorporating screenshot-based perceptual hashing. The second-level heuristic filter includes features like 'Zero Links' which are also informed by this evasion tactic. However, the paper does not address or evaluate resistance against more advanced active attacks. There is no discussion of defenses against dynamic content loading that requires user interaction (deferred execution), cloaking (where attackers serve benign content to the detector), or adversarial examples specifically crafted to bypass the machine learning-based heuristic filter. Therefore, it is resilient to some, but not all, relevant active attacks.",
