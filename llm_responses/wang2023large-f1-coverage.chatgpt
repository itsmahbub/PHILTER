{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishBERT employs a fully automated, domain-independent URL tokenization and large-scale pre-training on 3 billion URLs, making it tactic-agnostic by design and therefore capable of handling diverse URL-based phishing evasion strategies. However, the evaluation uses a monolithic PhishTank dataset without any breakdown of performance by specific tactics (e.g., homograph attacks, subdomain spoofing, IP-address URLs), thus lacking per-tactic reporting.","evidence":"Page 2, Section 2.2: “We create a purely automated tokenization scheme by learning the underlying syntactic structure of URL data… does not require any human intervention and avoids the bias of manual design.”; Page 3, Section 4 Metrics: “We use the following three metrics, accuracy, F1-score, TPR@FPR=0.01%.” (no per-tactic performance breakdown)"}
