{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation only uses popular, high-reputation websites (Alexa ranks 1–1,000 and 5,000–6,000) as benign samples and does not include any true long-tail or low-reputation domains (e.g., personal, regional, or recently registered sites) nor a dedicated set of benign pages featuring legitimate third-party brand elements (e.g., PayPal/OAuth widgets, social media buttons). Therefore, it fails to satisfy either subset required for a ‘High’ or even a ‘Medium’ rating.","evidence":"Page 11, Section 4.1 “Legitimate webpages were collected based on the Alexa top 1 million list… DS-1 consisting of 500 legitimate samples sourced from the top 1000 rank… The second dataset (DS-2) consists of 250 legitimate webpages ranked in between the top 5000 to 6000 of the Alexa top websites list.”"}
