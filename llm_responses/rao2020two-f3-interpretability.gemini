    "why": "The proposed method, BlackPhish, is a two-level system with inconsistent interpretability. \n\nThe first level, a blacklist filter based on visual and structural similarity, provides a limited but useful per-decision explanation. When it detects a phishing site, it also reports the legitimate brand being targeted, which gives the user valuable context for the classification. This is demonstrated in the system's user interface.\n\nThe second level, however, which handles sites that pass the first filter, uses a complex machine learning ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra-Tree classifiers. These models are inherently non-transparent, and the paper makes no effort to provide interpretability for their decisions. It does not employ any post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP or LIME, nor does it provide global insights such as feature importance rankings. The output for this stage is simply the classification label (phishing/legitimate) without any justification.\n\nSince the system provides a contextual, per-decision explanation for one of its core components (which the paper claims detects 55.58% of phishing sites) but offers no insight into the decisions of its other, more complex component, its overall interpretability is limited. It is not a pure black box, but it falls short of providing traceable or feature-based explanations for all its decisions.",
    "evidence": "Page 3, Section 1, Contributions: \"The BlackPhish provides additional target legitimate site information when the phishing site is detected by the blacklist filter.\"\n\nPage 18, Fig. 6 (a): The user interface for a blacklist detection explicitly states: \"Blacklist filter reported allbabybottle.com as phishing site targetting alibaba in 2.27 Sec.\"\n\nPage 15, Section 4.6.1: The paper describes the selection of complex, non-interpretable models for the heuristic filter: \"From the experimental results shown in Table 9, it is observed that XGBoost, Extra-Tree, RF classifiers outperformed others with significant accuracy and MCC. Hence, we choose these 3 classifiers to generate the ensemble model with majority voting strategy for the next experiments.\"\n\nPage 18, Fig. 6 (b): The user interface for a heuristic detection provides no reasoning, only the result: \"Heuristic filter reported isabellacano.com as phishing site in 2.62 Sec.\""
