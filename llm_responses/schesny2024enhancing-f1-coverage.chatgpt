  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not consider the diversity of phishing tactics: it evaluates the LLM-based detector solely on a small subset of 11 previously undetected websites without any categorization or breakdown by tactic (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, URL redirection). There is no discussion of handling multiple evasion strategies nor reporting per-tactic performance, indicating the method ignores tactic diversity.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section III: “In the end, 11 websites were considered for further analysis.”\n\nNo section of the paper describes phishing tactic categories, quantitative dataset breakdown by tactic, or performance per tactic."
