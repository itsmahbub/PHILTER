{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishFencing goes beyond a single‐tactic, brand‐logo matcher by combining visual spoofing detection (logo/sub‐image matching) with network‐identity analysis (IP/AS/geolocation) and even handles HTTPS‐hosted phishes via SNI inference. That means it is inherently resistant to URL-based evasion tactics (e.g. lexical tricks, domain squatting) and can detect anomalies in hosting strategies. However, it does not provide a per-tactic performance breakdown (e.g. separate metrics for compromised domains vs. shared hosting vs. homographs), so it meets “Medium” but not “High” according to the codebook.","evidence":"• Section 3.1 (Features): PhishFencing extracts logo features (visual identity) and host features (IP prefix, AS number, geolocation) rather than relying on URLs alone.  \n• Section 4.3 & 5.3: It explicitly handles HTTPS‐hosted phishing by crawling via SNI and reports separate recall for HTTP vs. HTTPS (26.32% recall on HTTPS).  \n• No per-tactic breakdown: The evaluation only splits by protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) and eight target brands, without reporting performance on distinct tactics such as subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, or compromised hosting."}
