{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates the proposed stacking ensemble solely on standard clean phishing vs. benign datasets (UCI and Mendeley) using static features and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F-score). There is no mention of testing against any active evasive attacks (e.g., obfuscated JavaScript, cloaking, dynamic content, adversarial perturbations) nor any dynamic or adversarial evaluation. Thus it provides no evidence of robustness to active attacks within its URL/HTML-feature scope.","evidence":"Abstract, page 1: “From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed model achieved a significant performance when evaluated with different datasets with an accuracy of ranging from 96.79% to 98.90%.”; Section IV, page 8: “The proposed model is evaluated by applying on different datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) with and without data balancing.”"}
