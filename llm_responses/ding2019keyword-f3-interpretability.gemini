    "why": "The proposed SHLR method is a three-stage cascaded model. The first two stages are inherently interpretable. The first stage uses a clear rule: if a URL's domain appears in the top-10 search engine results for its page title, it is classified as legitimate. The second stage applies a set of seven explicit, human-readable heuristic rules to detect specific URL obfuscation patterns. For any URL classified in these first two stages, the exact reason for the decision is transparent. The third stage, however, uses a Logistic Regression (LR) classifier with 78 features for the remaining URLs. While LR models are generally more interpretable than deep learning models (as one can inspect feature coefficients for global importance), the paper does not mention using any technique (e.g., LIME, SHAP) to provide per-decision explanations for this component. The system, therefore, combines components with high per-decision traceability (rules) with a component that offers only global or limited insight (the LR classifier). This aligns with the 'Medium' fulfillment criteria, as it uses inherently interpretable models but does not provide traceable per-decision explanations for all of its classifications, specifically those made by the final LR stage.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3, details the three-stage process: \"Step 2. Use the content of the web’s title tag as the search keywords in the Baidu search engine. The webpage is legal if the webpage domain matches the domain name of any of the top-10 search results. If the domain is absent from the ten search results, then the procedure continues to Step 3. Step 3. Enter the heuristic rule-based detection phase. Step 4. Check the URL against the rules in the rule base; if the URL matches, the webpage is classified as a phishing webpage. Otherwise, the procedure continues to Step 5. Step 5. Enter the logistic regression (LR) classifier-based detection phase. ... Step 7. Use a logistic regression classifier to assess the webpage.\"\n\nThe paper explicitly defines the heuristic rules, making that stage interpretable. For example, from Page 8, Section 3.2: \"Rule 5. An IP address is used as the domain name. This site is considered to be a phishing site.\"\n\nThe final stage is described on Page 11, Section 3.3.6: \"In this paper, five feature types are selected to define the feature vector of the URL... Then, the LR classifier is used for further testing to determine the nature of the webpage.\" The paper discusses selecting the LR classifier based on performance but does not mention any mechanism for explaining its individual predictions."
