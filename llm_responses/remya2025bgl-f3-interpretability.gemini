    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed BGL-PhishNet model is an ensemble of three complex models: BERT, GNN, and LightGBM. The final prediction is derived from a weighted voting system that combines the outputs of these individual models. The paper does not describe any mechanism, either through inherently interpretable models or post-hoc XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME), to explain the reasoning behind a specific classification. BERT and GNN are treated as black-box feature extractors. While the paper mentions that the case study system \"provided detailed reports explaining why a website was flagged,\" this claim is not substantiated in the technical sections. The methodology describes a system that outputs a classification label and a confidence score, but provides no insight into which features or model components led to that decision, making it a black box.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section VII-D. ENSEMBLE MECHANISM: \"The classification of URLs within the hybrid system in the ensemble framework is done by BERT, GNNs and LightGBM. This system utilizes a weighted voting system where the votes are multiplied according to their validation scores. The weights are estimated by cross-validation and the maximum weight will be given to models that are more reliable.\"\n\nPage 9, Section VIII. ARCHITECTURE AND WORKING: \"The output layer provides the classification at the end. In case of detecting a phishing URL, it classifies the output as 'phishing'... Otherwise, it classifies as a ‘legitimate’... The system might also provide a likelihood score, which indicates the percentage of how likely the URL considered belongs to the likely class.\"\n\nPage 9, Section F. FINAL DECISION: The final decision is described by the equation `ŷi = { 1 if P(xi) ≥ τ; 0 if P(xi) < τ }`, where P(xi) is the aggregated probability. This shows the output is purely a classification based on a threshold, without an explanatory component."
