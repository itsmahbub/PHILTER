{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed URL-based detector employs features that capture a variety of evasion tactics—typosquatting and brand-name similarity, Punycode homograph attacks, random-character sequences, special-character obfuscation, subdomain spoofing, etc.—but its evaluation reports only overall accuracy on a large mixed dataset and does not break down performance by tactic or annotate the dataset accordingly.","evidence":"Page 350 (Section 4.2–4.4): Table 2 lists NLP features targeting multiple tactics (e.g., “Puny Code” for homograph attacks; “Random Word Count” for random strings; “Special Character (8)” for URL obfuscation). Page 354 (Section 5.5): Table 5 shows only aggregate accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure on 37,175 phishing URLs, with no per-tactic performance breakdown."}
