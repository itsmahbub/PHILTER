    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a dedicated and comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's robustness against a diverse set of active attacks, which are explicitly defined in its threat model. The evaluation is modality-aware, targeting the system's core components: its screenshot-based visual analysis, LLM-based reasoning, and dynamic interaction model. The authors construct, test, and report quantitative results against four distinct attack types: (1) visual logo manipulation, (2) prompt injection attacks against the LLM, (3) pixel-level adversarial perturbations against the visual-language model, and (4) HTML obfuscation where text is replaced by images. The system's design also inherently addresses dynamic evasions; it handles deferred content loading by simulating clicks to find credential-requiring pages and explicitly manages redirects. For identified vulnerabilities like prompt injection and adversarial perturbations, the authors incorporate and evaluate specific defense mechanisms (e.g., instruction encapsulation, gradient masking), demonstrating a proactive approach to security.",
    "evidence": "Page 9-10, Section 4.4, 'RQ3: Robustness Evaluation': The paper outlines its evaluation against active attacks: 'Since PhishLLM employs a prompt-based design, we construct adversarial attacks by injecting misleading instructions either into the webpage content or the logo to mislead the LLM prediction. Logo Adversary Attack (phishing domain injection for brand recognition)... LLM Prompt Injection Attack (for CRP prediction)... Pixel-level Perturbation Attack (for CRP transition)... HTML Obfuscation Attack (for webpage parsing)...'.\n\nPage 4, Section 3, 'Approach': The method is designed to handle multi-page scenarios and deferred execution: 'If not, we proceed to use a visual-language model to rank HTML elements that could link to a credential-taking page within the same domain. We then simulate clicks on these elements to search for credential-taking pages. This process iterates until either a phishing page is confirmed or a predefined interaction limit is met.'\n\nPage 6, Section 3.1.4, 'Adaptation to Domain Variants': The method accounts for redirects: 'When a redirection happens, we will re-run PhishLLM on the updated URL and screenshot...This prevents potential false positives.'\n\nPage 11, Section 4.5.2, 'Results': The paper confirms the effectiveness of its built-in defenses: 'The CRP prediction model is minimally affected by the prompt injection attack, with a recall decrease of only 0.01, thanks to the prompt defense mechanism... Furthermore, the introduced gradient-masking defense, as proposed in [47], can effectively protect against gradient-based adversarial attacks. Finally, due to the adopted OCR technique, PhishLLM is robust against HTML obfuscation.'"
