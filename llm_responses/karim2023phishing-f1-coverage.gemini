    "why": "The proposed URL-based method addresses multiple phishing tactics through its feature engineering. The selected attributes are designed to capture common URL manipulation techniques, such as using IP addresses instead of hostnames, lexical manipulations (prefix/suffix additions), subdomain spoofing, and HTTPS misuse. This indicates a consideration for tactic diversity in the model's design. However, the paper's evaluation is monolithic; it provides overall performance metrics for the entire test set but does not offer a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation dataset by tactic, nor does it report the detection performance for each specific tactic. The evaluation treats all phishing URLs as a single class, failing to analyze the model's robustness against different attack vectors.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section III.A, 'URL BASED PHISHING DATASET': \"The phishing and legitimate website URLs contain some common attributes such as UsingIP, LongURL, ShortURL, Symbol@, Redirecting//, PrefixSuffix-, Sub-Domains, HTTPS, DomainRegLen, Favicon, NonStdPort, HTTPSDomainURL, Reques- tURL, AnchorURL, LinksIn- ScriptTags, and ServerFormHandler, which help to identify whether the URL is phishing.\" This quote demonstrates the use of features that correspond to specific phishing tactics. However, the results sections (e.g., Section IV, Tables 2-10) present only aggregate performance metrics like accuracy and precision across the entire dataset, with no analysis of how the model performs on URLs exhibiting these specific features."
