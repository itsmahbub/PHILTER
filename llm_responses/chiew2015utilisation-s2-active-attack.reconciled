{"value":"Low","why":"The paper includes no systematic evaluation of active evasions within its logo‐based modality. All experiments use clean samples from PhishTank and Alexa without deliberately manipulated logos (e.g., with noise, obfuscation, invisibility, or cloaking) or dynamic loading attacks. The single mention of phishers “slightly altering the logo image (e.g., scaling down a logo image)” is only motivational and not backed by targeted adversarial tests. Hence it provides no demonstrated robustness against active attacks relevant to its scope.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 3.3: “We have constructed two non‐overlapping datasets from a total of 1140 webpages … Phishing webpages are downloaded from PhishTank and legitimate webpages are from Alexa … The final detection performance of the whole proposed method is measured using dataset 2.”"}
