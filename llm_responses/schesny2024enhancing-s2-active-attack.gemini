    "why": "The paper proposes an LLM-based method that analyzes URLs, HTML content, and OCR from screenshots. The evaluation is based on re-testing 11 phishing websites that were previously misclassified by another study. The paper does not investigate or report whether these websites employ any active evasion techniques, such as code obfuscation, junk HTML, cloaking, or dynamic content loading. The experimental scenarios focus on manipulating the prompt sent to the LLM (e.g., adding social pressure) rather than testing the system's resilience to adversarial manipulations of the website content itself. The evaluation is therefore limited to a benchmark of clean phishing vs. benign examples, without any consideration for active attacks or evasions relevant to the system's input modalities.",
    "evidence": "page 1, Section II-A, Scenarios: The experimental design tests variations in the prompt, not resistance to website-based attacks. For instance, 'For Scenario 2, social pressure was placed on ChatGPT, and threats of job loss were made in the event that the website was not identified as phishing.' This tests prompt robustness, not evasion resistance.\npage 2, Section III, Results and Discussion: The dataset is described as 'phishing websites that had not been identified' by a previous study. The paper's analysis focuses on reproducing results and comparing phishing scores, but it does not analyze the websites for any specific adversarial characteristics designed to evade detection. The paper makes no claims about resilience to active attacks."
