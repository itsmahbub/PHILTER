{"value":"Medium","why":"DynaPhish is designed to handle multiple phishing tactics—specifically, novel brands (T1), implicit or brandless pages (T2), and obfuscated/adversarial content (T3)—and adapts its reference set at runtime to cover unknown brands. However, while the paper demonstrates end-to-end improvements in recall, it does not provide a quantitative per-tactic breakdown of detection performance, nor does it explicitly evaluate its coverage of the full spectrum of real-world evasion strategies listed in the codebook.","evidence":"Section 2 Threat Model (T1–T3 listing novel brands, brandless pages, obfuscated content) and Section 5 Experimental Results (overall recall improvements reported without per-tactic performance)."}
