{"value":"High","why":"The proposed technique relies on inherently stable identity features (visual logos and textual brand keywords) rather than adversarial cues that change over time, and its evaluation explicitly tests performance on webpage samples drawn from two disjoint time periods (2018 and 2020), demonstrating resilience to concept drift.","evidence":"Section 1 Introduction: “identity-based techniques do not depend on dynamically evolving adversarial patterns in the phishing webpage” (avoids volatile features by design). Section 4.1 Dataset preparation: “webpage samples were downloaded from … September to December 2018 and from January to March 2020” (evaluation on data from different time periods)."}
