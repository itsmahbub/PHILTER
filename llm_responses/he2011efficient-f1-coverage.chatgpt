{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed detector incorporates multiple tactic-agnostic features—e.g. detecting IP-address URLs and ‘@’ URLs (Feature 1), SSL misuse (Feature 9), lexical/domain mismatches (Feature 2), foreign anchors/requests (Features 4–7), and URL-dot counting (Features 10–11)—but the evaluation only reports overall detection rates and does not provide a per-tactic performance breakdown.","evidence":"Page 12021–12023, Section 4 (Features 1–11 describe tactics addressed: IP URLs, SSL certificates, domain/identity mismatches, etc.); Page 12024, Section 5 (evaluation only reports overall TP/FP rates with no per-tactic breakdown)."}
