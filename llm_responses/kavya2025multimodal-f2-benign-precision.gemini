    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation of benign pages is limited to high-reputation, popular websites. The authors explicitly state that their legitimate validation samples are sourced from 'popularly accessed sites, such as Amazon, Gmail, and PayPal.' This approach does not fulfill the criteria for a diverse benign dataset, as it fails to include low-reputation or long-tail domains (e.g., small businesses, personal blogs) or pages that legitimately use third-party brand elements (like an e-commerce site with a PayPal widget). Consequently, the reported false positive rate may not accurately reflect the model's performance on more ambiguous and challenging benign cases that are commonly misclassified by phishing detectors.",
    "evidence": "Page 15, Section A. VALIDATION USING ITERATIVE PRACTICAL USE CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS, \"The legitimate validation samples are obtained from popularly accessed sites, such as Amazon, Gmail, and PayPal, to vary webpage structure, visual elements, and metadata samples.\""
