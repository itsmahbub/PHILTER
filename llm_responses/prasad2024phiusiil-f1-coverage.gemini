    "why": "The paper explicitly designs its method to counter a variety of phishing tactics. The core URL Similarity Index (USI) component is specifically proposed to detect a range of visual similarity-based attacks, including homographs, punycode, homophones, bit squatting, and combosquatting. The feature engineering phase also incorporates features to handle other tactics, such as the use of IP addresses as domains (`IsDomainIP`), subdomain spoofing (`NoOfSubDomain`), and URL redirection (`NoOfURLRedirect`). The evaluation includes a dedicated table (Table 4) that provides concrete examples of the USI's effectiveness against character-level manipulation attacks, which constitutes a form of per-tactic analysis. However, the paper does not meet the 'High' criteria because it lacks a quantitative breakdown of its large evaluation dataset by tactic category and does not report comprehensive performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, recall) for each of the diverse tactics it claims to address.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: 'The similarity index helps effectively identify visual similarity-based attacks such as zero-width characters, homograph, punycode, homophone, bit squatting, and combosquatting attacks.'\nPage 5, Section 3.1.2. Extracting URL features: 'IsDomainIP: a URL using an IP address instead of a domain name can be a red flag for users. NoOfSubDomain: Subdomain is part of URL that appears before domain name. Cybercriminals often use visual similarity techniques to trick users. They create subdomains that look like subdomain of legitimate websites.'\nPage 6, Section 3.1.3. Extracting HTML features: 'NoOfURLRedirect: Phishing sites may use redirects to direct users to a different page than they were expecting.'\nPage 13, Table 4: This table, 'Experimental result showing URL similarity based phishing URL detection,' provides specific examples of how the USI identifies phishing URLs based on character manipulations like 'Latin e with dot below symbol', 'Missing e', and swapped characters, demonstrating its capability against typosquatting and visual deception tactics."
