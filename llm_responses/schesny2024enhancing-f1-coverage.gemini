    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper focuses on refining an LLM-based detection approach through prompt engineering but does not address the diversity of phishing tactics. The evaluation is conducted on a very small, convenience-based dataset of 11 previously misclassified websites, with no information provided about the specific phishing strategies (e.g., homograph attacks, subdomain spoofing, compromised hosting) employed by these sites. The paper's analysis concentrates on aggregate detection rates under different prompting scenarios rather than assessing performance against a varied set of attack vectors. This approach aligns with the 'Low' criteria, as it uses an evaluation dataset with no information on phishing tactic diversity and ignores the concept in its methodology and discussion.",
    "evidence": "Page 2, Section III: \"In our investigation, we analyzed the JSON files from the previous study [6] to examine phishing websites that had not been identified... As a result, these 48 websites were not included in our study. In the end, 11 websites were considered for further analysis.\" \nPage 2, Section III: \"The hit rates for detected threats are the same for Scenario 2 and 3, with five out of eleven websites detected. In Scenario 1, four websites were successfully identified, and one was marked with the status 'unknown'.\""
