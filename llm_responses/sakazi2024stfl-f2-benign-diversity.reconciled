{"value":"Medium","why":"The evaluation includes benign URLs from Common Crawl, which inherently covers a broad range of low-reputation and long-tail domains, but it does not include any curated benign pages with legitimate embedded brand elements (e.g., PayPal or social-login widgets). Thus it fulfills only one of the two required diversity criteria.","evidence":"Page 5, Section V.A (“Datasets”): “CPURNN … 1,200,000 benign URLs from Common Crawl.”\nPage 5, Section V.A (“Datasets”): “PDRCNN … 245,023 benign URLs … from the Alexa 1M URLs.” No dataset or evaluation is described that incorporates pages with legitimate brand-element usage."}
