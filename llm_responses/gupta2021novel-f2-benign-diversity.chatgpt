{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation uses only the ISCXURL-2016 public dataset’s benign URLs without any indication that these include low-reputation/long-tail domains or pages legitimately embedding brand elements. There is no discussion of sampling small/regional sites, recently registered domains, personal subdomains, or benign pages with PayPal/OAuth widgets or social media logos, so the false-positive rate may not reflect performance on harder, diverse benign cases.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 4.3: “To evaluate our proposed approach, we have used a dataset ‘ISCXURL-2016’ … We have extracted 10 000 benign and 9964 phishing URLs …” (no further breakdown by domain reputation or brand-element usage)"}
