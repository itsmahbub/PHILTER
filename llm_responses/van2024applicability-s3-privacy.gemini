    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a hybrid framework that processes several types of potentially sensitive user data, including full URLs, HTML content, and HTML DOM tree structures. However, the paper makes no mention of the deployment architecture or any privacy-preserving mechanisms. It is not specified whether the analysis is intended to run locally on a client device, at a secure gateway, or on an external server, which would involve transmitting this sensitive data. The research focuses exclusively on evaluating the framework's effectiveness, robustness, and speed, omitting privacy as a design principle or evaluation criterion. The six applicability factors identified and discussed from the literature (Effectiveness, Speed of Detection, Scalability, Adaptation, Flexibility, and Robustness) do not include privacy. As per the codebook, when no inference-time data-handling details or privacy safeguards are described, the rating is Low.",
    "evidence": "page 2, Section 1: \"We devise and test a proof of concept consisting of three specific deep learning models, each analyzing a different website feature: URL, HTML content, and HTML DOM tree structure.\"\n\npage 2, Section 1: \"Secondly, we build a proof of concept of the hybrid framework and test it on effectiveness, robustness, and detection speed. We test for only these three factors as the other three factors of applicability (scalability, adaptation, flexibility) are, in principle, enhanced by a modular architecture.\"\n\npage 4, Section 3.1: The paper lists and discusses five design principles from Sahoo et al. (2017) and adds a sixth, Robustness: \"Accuracy [Effectiveness], Speed of Detection, Scalability, Adaptation, Flexibility\". Privacy is not mentioned as a factor for applicability. The entire paper lacks any discussion on where the inference would take place (client vs. server) or any mechanisms (e.g., hashing, anonymization) to protect user data."
