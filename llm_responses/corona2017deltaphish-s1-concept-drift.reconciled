{"value":"Medium","why":"DeltaPhish is explicitly designed around a core signal—structural and visual dissimilarity between a suspect page and the legitimate homepage—that does not rely on drift-prone features (e.g. domain age or URL lexical patterns). This reliance on an inherently stable identity feature meets the codebook’s criterion for resisting concept drift by design. However, the evaluation does not employ any time-aware protocol (the authors randomly split their dataset by website families, rather than training on older samples and testing on newer ones), so it cannot be rated “High.”","evidence":"Page 3 (Sect. 1): “The key idea behind our approach… is to compare the HTML code and the visual appearance of potential phishing pages against the corresponding characteristics of the homepage of the compromised (hosting) website.”\nPage 12 (Sect. 4.1): “In each repetition, we randomly select 60% of the families for training, while the remaining 40% are used for testing.”"}
