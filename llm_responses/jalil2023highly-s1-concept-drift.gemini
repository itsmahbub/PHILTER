    "why": "The paper assumes that phishing tactics are static and does not address the problem of concept drift. The methodology lacks two key components required for a higher rating:\n\n1.  **No Adaptive Strategy or Inherently Stable Features**: The proposed method uses a fixed set of 30 lexical features (e.g., presence of special characters, suspicious words, URL length) and trains a static machine learning model (Random Forest). There are no provisions for adapting to new attack patterns, such as online learning, periodic retraining, or time-aware feature engineering. The features themselves are not designed to be inherently stable against evolving attacker tactics.\n\n2.  **No Temporal Evaluation Protocol**: The experiments are conducted using a standard 70/30 train-test split on static datasets. This evaluation method randomly mixes older and newer samples, which does not simulate a real-world deployment where a model trained on past data must perform on future, unseen attacks. A temporal evaluation (training on older data and testing on newer data) is necessary to assess resilience to concept drift, but this is absent from the paper's methodology.",
    "evidence": "page 11, Section 3.3, 'In this paper, we have used 70% data for training the models and 30% data for testing the models.'\n\npage 6, Section 3, 'Secondly, the dataset is divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing the model. The training dataset is to train the machine learning model and then evaluate the performance of the trained model on testing dataset.'\n\npage 9, Table 3, 'List of proposed 30 features'. This table defines the static feature set used for classification, with no mechanism described for updating or adapting these features over time."
