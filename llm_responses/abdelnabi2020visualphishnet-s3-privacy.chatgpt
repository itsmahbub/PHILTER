{"value": "Low", "why": "The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving deployment or data‐handling mechanism. The proposed system requires full webpage screenshots (potentially containing sensitive URL parameters and user data) to be input to a centralized model for feature extraction and distance computation, with no mention of on-device inference, hashed lookups, federated learning, or anonymized features.", "evidence": "Page 7, Section 5.3 Prediction: “At test time, … we use the shared network to compute the embeddings then we compute the L2 distance between the embeddings of the test screenshot and all training screenshots.” No client‐side or privacy‐preserving mechanism is specified."}
