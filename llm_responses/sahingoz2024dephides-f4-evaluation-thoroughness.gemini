    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper provides a strong evaluation by reporting key class-sensitive metrics, which are essential for understanding performance in imbalanced scenarios like phishing detection. The authors explicitly define and report values for Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, breaking them down by class (phishing vs. legitimate). This demonstrates a clear understanding of the limitations of accuracy alone. However, the evaluation does not meet the 'High' criteria as it omits any of the required summary metrics like AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC, which would provide a more holistic view of the model's classification quality across all decision thresholds or by considering all four confusion matrix components.",
    "evidence": "Page 16, Section V.E, 'EVALUATION CRITERIA': The paper explicitly defines the class-sensitive metrics used: 'The metrics used for the evaluation of the test results are as follows: precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy. These statistics, whose formulation is depicted in Equations (1)-(4), are also important for making a comparison between the tested machine learning approaches.'\nPage 14, Table 9, 'Performance metrics of CNN1 architecture with 20 epochs.': This table reports the values for Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for both the 'Phishing' and 'Legitimate' classes, showing a detailed, class-aware evaluation. For example, for the Phishing class, it reports a Precision of 0.98, Recall of 0.99, and F1-Score of 0.99.\nPage 15, Table 10, 'Performance metrics of CNN algorithms with 20 epochs.': This table further reinforces the use of these metrics by comparing different CNN architectures, with columns for Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for both Phishing and Legitimate classes."
