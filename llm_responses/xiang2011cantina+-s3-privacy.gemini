    "why": "The proposed method, CANTINA+, relies on a set of \"Web-Based Features\" that require sending sensitive information about the visited webpage to external, third-party services during the detection phase. Specifically, features for domain age (WHOIS lookup), PageRank, and search engine presence involve transmitting the page's domain name, hostname, and keywords extracted from its content to external servers like Google. This process effectively exposes the user's browsing history and the content of visited pages to third parties without any mentioned privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as hashing or anonymization. The system architecture diagram explicitly shows the feature extractor communicating with search engines and third-party services, confirming this external data transmission as a core part of the detection process.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 6.1, Web-Based Features: \"(11) Age of domain. This feature checks the age of the Web page domain name via WHOIS lookups... (12) Page in top search results... we extract the top K words from the page content ranked by the term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) metric, and search those top terms plus the Web page domain keyword in Google... (14) Page in top results when searching copyright company name and domain. This... feature uses as query phrase the page domain plus the copyright company name that is usually found on the bottom of a Web page showing a Web site's brand name...\" \nPage 6, Figure 1: The system architecture diagram visually depicts arrows from the \"Feature Extractor\" to \"Third-party Services\" and \"Search engine\", indicating that data is sent to these external entities as part of the feature extraction process."
