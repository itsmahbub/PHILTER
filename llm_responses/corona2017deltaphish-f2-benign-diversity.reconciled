{"value":"Low","why":"The benign dataset is drawn exclusively from 3–5 pages per compromised site, with no explicit effort to include low-reputation/long-tail domains (the sample is simply “all” compromised hosts) or any pages embedding legitimate third-party brand elements. It therefore meets neither of the two diversity criteria.","evidence":"Page 13, Section 4.1: “By parsing the hyperlinks in the HTML code of the homepage, we have collected from 3 to 5 legitimate pages from the same website, and validated them manually.” No mention is made of selecting low-reputation domains or pages with legitimate PayPal/OAuth/social media widgets."}
