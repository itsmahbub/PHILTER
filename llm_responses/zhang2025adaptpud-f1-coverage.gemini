    "why": "The paper explicitly addresses a diverse set of URL-based phishing tactics, particularly what it terms \"tailored deceptive P-URLs.\" The methodology, Token-Property Embedding (TPE), is designed to differentiate between semantic content and its structural position within the URL, making it inherently suited to detect tactics like subdomain spoofing or abuse of trusted hosting platforms. The evaluation provides a dedicated \"Practical application\" section that tests the model against 30 active phishing URLs. This test set is quantitatively broken down into two categories: \"general P-URLs\" (10) and \"tailored deceptive P-URLs\" (20). The paper reports detection performance for each category, showing their method achieved 100% accuracy while baselines struggled significantly with the tailored URLs. The discussion explicitly analyzes the model's success against specific tactics observed in the test set, including abuse of cloud platforms (GitHub, Webflow), typosquatting, link shorteners, and the use of Pinyin domains. This combination of addressing multiple tactics, providing a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation set by tactic type, and reporting performance for each type fulfills the criteria for a \"High\" rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 5.4, Practical application: \"In January 2025, we collected 30 active P-URLs from PhishTank, categorizing them into two groups: general P-URLs and tailored deceptive P-URLs. All detection instances are listed in Table 7 for subsequent detailed analysis. AdaptPUD performs exceptionally well across both categories, with 100% detection accuracy. The other baselines perform poorly, especially for tailored deceptive P-URLs. The best baseline is TransURL, with 70% accuracy for general P-URLs and 30% accuracy for tailored deceptive P-URLs.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 5.4, Discussion paragraph: \"Abuse of cloud-based platforms. In view of the convenience and legitimacy of cloud platforms, attackers often design deceptive subdomains and host them on cloud-based legitimate domains (such as Weebly, Webflow, GitHub, and GitBook) to increase their overall legitimacy. Additionally, short link services such as qrco.de and t.ly are commonly abused... Look-alike domains. Attackers frequently use typosquatting to create look-alike domains... Specific use of Pinyin domains.\"\n\nPage 11, Table 7, Practical application data analysis: This table provides the full list of the 30 URLs tested, which serve as concrete examples of the tactics discussed, such as `https://secure-trezor-en.github.io/en-us/` (abuse of trusted platform) and `https://t.ly/LIMBA` (link shortener). The table also reports the binary detection outcome for each model against each URL, confirming the performance claims."
