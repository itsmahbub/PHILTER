    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a machine learning model and evaluates it on four standard benchmark datasets. The evaluation is conducted using aggregate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. The paper completely ignores the concept of phishing tactic diversity. There is no discussion or analysis of the different types of phishing attacks (e.g., subdomain spoofing, HTTPS misuse, compromised domains, etc.) that may be present in the evaluation datasets. Consequently, the paper does not provide any breakdown of the dataset composition by tactic, nor does it report the model's performance against specific attack types. The focus is entirely on the performance of the ensemble architecture, not on its robustness against a varied landscape of real-world phishing strategies.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Table 1, 'Description of both datasets.': The description provided for each of the four datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4) is limited to the number of features, the number of instances, and the distribution of legitimate vs. phishing samples. For example, for D1, the description is: 'It consists 30 features with 11055 instances. In which, 4898 are legitimate and 6157 are phishing.' This demonstrates a lack of information or consideration for the diversity of tactics within the phishing samples.\n\nPage 7 & 8, Tables 2-8: The entire performance evaluation is based on aggregate metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score) calculated over the entirety of each test dataset. There is no fine-grained analysis showing how the model performs on different subsets of the data representing different phishing tactics.\n\nPage 2, Section I, Contributions: The paper frames its contributions as: 'We proposed a multi layer staked ensemble model combining various classifiers at different layers for the detection of phishing sites.' and 'We conducted experiments on various datasets of different size (11 K, 10K, 58 K, 88 K) and different feature space (30,48,111,111) to evaluate the behavior of the model with varying dataset.' The contributions focus on the model's architecture and its behavior on datasets of varying size and feature dimensions, not on its ability to handle diverse phishing tactics."
