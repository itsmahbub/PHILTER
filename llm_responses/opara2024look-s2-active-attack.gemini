    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation is limited to a static, non-adversarial dataset compiled from Alexa and PhishTank. There are no experiments designed to assess the model's resilience against active attacks or evasive maneuvers. The method performs a static analysis of the URL and initial HTML source, making it inherently vulnerable to dynamic evasions like JavaScript-based content loading, cloaking, or deferred execution, none of which are considered. The authors explicitly acknowledge in the limitations section that the model cannot handle visual-based attacks (e.g., image-based phishing) and may fail against \"rare manipulation of the web page content,\" which would include novel obfuscation techniques or adversarial examples. The evaluation is strictly a benchmark on clean phishing vs. benign examples, lacking any test of robustness against deliberate manipulation.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 6.4, Limitations of WebPhish: \"While we argue that WebPhish can detect zero-day phishing attacks that contain known phishing HTML and URL content, if the zero-day phishing attack involves a rare manipulation of the web page content, WebPhish may miss it. Additionally, as the proposed model is not visual based, the model cannot classify web pages where DOM is predominantly embedded images or flashes.\"\nPage 6, Section 4.2, Dataset: \"To train our models, we used real-world datasets from Alexa.com for legitimate web pages and phishtank.com for phishing web pages to address the evaluation questions above... Subsequently, our final corpus contained a balanced dataset of 45,373 phishing and benign instances.\" This describes a standard dataset collection process without any mention of selecting or generating examples with evasive techniques."
