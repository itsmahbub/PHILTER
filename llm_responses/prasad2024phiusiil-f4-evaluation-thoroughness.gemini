    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper demonstrates a comprehensive and robust evaluation methodology by utilizing a full suite of performance metrics that are well-suited for the class imbalance inherent in phishing detection. The authors explicitly define and report on class-sensitive metrics including Precision, Recall (referred to as Sensitivity in some tables), and F1-Score. Crucially, they also include the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as a summary metric, which is highly appropriate for evaluating binary classification quality on imbalanced data. These metrics are consistently used across multiple experimental tables to compare different algorithms, security profiles, and training configurations, ensuring a thorough and meaningful assessment of the proposed model's performance.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 5.2, Performance metrics: The paper explicitly defines the metrics used for evaluation: \"The following metrics help assess how well the proposed model is performing. Accuracy = ... Precision = ... Recall = ... F1Score = ... MCC = ...\" This section provides the formulas for True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative, demonstrating a clear understanding of classification evaluation. \n\nPage 12, Table 3, Performance of various machine learning algorithms on Phishing URL dataset: This table reports the results of various algorithms on the constructed dataset, and includes columns for \"Accuracy\", \"Precision\", \"Recall\", \"F1Score\", and \"MCC\", thereby fulfilling all criteria for a high rating. \n\nPage 13, Table 5, Security profile wise performance of the proposed model: This table evaluates the proposed model's different security profiles and reports on \"Accuracy\", \"Precision\", \"Sensitivity\" (Recall), \"F1Score\", and \"MCC\", again confirming the use of all required metrics."
