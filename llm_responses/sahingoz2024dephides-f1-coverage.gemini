    "why": "The paper's proposed method, which relies on character-level embeddings of URLs processed by deep learning models, is inherently designed to be tactic-agnostic. The authors explicitly state that this approach avoids the pitfalls of brittle feature engineering and keyword searches, allowing it to generalize to various forms of lexical manipulation (e.g., misspellings) and different languages. This design choice addresses multiple URL-based phishing tactics implicitly. However, the evaluation does not provide a breakdown of the large-scale dataset by the specific phishing tactics represented (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, IP-based URLs). Consequently, the paper does not report detection performance on a per-tactic basis, instead presenting aggregated results for the entire 'phishing' class. The method addresses tactic diversity by its generalizable design, but this is not quantitatively verified in the evaluation.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section C, OVERVIEW OF TESTED ALGORITHMS: \"Many deep learning approaches eliminate the need for the feature engineering step. Basic keyword searches are a method that can be easily avoided. For instance, instead of using amazonsecurelogin.com, a similar domain like amazonserucelogn.com could be employed for attacks. Since the words “secure” and “login\" are not used directly in this example, keyword checking may not be successful. Furthermore, attackers can not only target English but also launch regional attacks by creating URLs based on the language of that region.\"\n\nPage 17, Section A, LANGUAGE INDEPENDENCE: \"In contrast, the proposed system can detect phishing using URL information alone, focusing solely on the characters within the URL. This word-independent approach enables the system to detect phishing attacks regardless of the language used.\"\n\nPage 8, Section IV.A, DATASET COLLECTION: The paper describes collecting phishing URLs from PhishTank, a large public repository. However, it provides no information on the distribution of different attack tactics within this collected dataset.\n\nPage 14, Table 9: Performance metrics are presented for the general 'Phishing' and 'Legitimate' classes, with no finer-grained analysis based on specific phishing tactics."
