{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates ChatPhishDetector solely on a curated dataset of real-world phishing and benign sites, without any experiments against deliberate evasive manipulations (e.g. junk HTML, obfuscated JavaScript, hidden elements, cloaking, deferred execution, or adversarial perturbations) within its input modalities (URL, HTML, screenshots). There is no mention of testing resistance to active attacks or adversarial evasion techniques, only classification accuracy on a clean dataset.","evidence":"Section IV (Dataset): “we curated … 1,000 phishing sites and an equal number of non-phishing sites.” Section V (Evaluation): “we performed experiments with different LLMs … and compared … existing systems.” No evaluation against manipulated or evasive samples is described."}
