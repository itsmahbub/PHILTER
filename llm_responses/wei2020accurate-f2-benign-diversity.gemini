    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation includes a diverse set of low-reputation and long-tail benign domains by deliberately moving away from top-ranked lists. The authors initially used high-reputation datasets (Moz Top 500, Alexa) but recognized the resulting bias. To correct this, they collected a balanced dataset of \"random unique URLs from the Common Crawl database.\" This method is effective for capturing a wide variety of legitimate domains beyond just popular ones. However, the proposed detector exclusively analyzes the URL string and does not parse webpage content. As a result, the evaluation inherently cannot assess the model's performance on the second diversity criterion: benign pages that legitimately use third-party brand elements (e.g., PayPal buttons, OAuth widgets). Because the evaluation fulfills only one of the two required criteria for a 'High' rating, it is classified as 'Medium'.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 4.1, Phishing dataset: \"The initial experiments were performed with The Moz Top 500 [31] and the Alexa datasets. As they contain top-level domains only, it caused a strong bias towards short, top-domain URLs. Then, we downloaded 10,604 random unique URLs from the Common Crawl database. We wanted the legitimate set not to dominate addresses from the second class. In this case, we have an ideal situation for the classification and a balanced set of 50% of phishing addresses and 50% of the top URL addresses used every day by Internet users.\"\n\nPage 1, Abstract: \"Contrary to the previous works, where URL or traffic statistics or web content are analysed, we analyse only the URL text. Thus, the method is faster and detects zero-day attacks.\""
