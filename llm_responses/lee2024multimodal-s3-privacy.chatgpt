{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed system extracts full webpage screenshots and HTML content from the user’s device and transmits them to external commercial LLM APIs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude) for inference. No on-device processing or privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., hashed lookups, federated learning, or anonymized features) are described, so sensitive page contents are sent off-device unprotected.","evidence":"Section III.A (page 3): “These two outputs, the visual representation via the screenshot and the textual data extracted from the HTML, are subsequently provided to a multimodal LLM.”; Section V (page 6): “We experiment with three commercial LLMs—Google Gemini Pro-Vision 1.0, OpenAI GPT-4-turbo, and Anthropic Claude3 Opus.”"}
