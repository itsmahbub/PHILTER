This self-contained design meets the “High” criterion of local on-client detection with no external data transmission.","evidence":"Page 3 (end of Section I): “The proposed work does not employ third-party solutions … emphasizing a self-contained and independent approach in the study’s methodology.”; Page 4 (Contribution #5): “Independence from Third-Party Services: The proposed system operates independently of third-party services … enhancing the self-sufficiency of the detection mechanism.”"}
