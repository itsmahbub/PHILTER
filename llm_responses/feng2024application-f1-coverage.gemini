    "why": "The proposed method addresses multiple phishing tactics through its feature engineering. It utilizes a comprehensive set of 30 features divided into four categories: address bar-based, abnormal-based, HTML/JavaScript-based, and domain-based. This feature set is capable of capturing various phishing tactics, including the use of IP addresses in URLs (`having_IP_Address`), HTTPS misuse (`SSLfinal_State`), and URL lexical manipulations like subdomain spoofing (`having_Sub_Domain`). However, the evaluation falls short of the 'High' criteria. The paper uses a standard dataset from the UCI repository but does not provide any quantitative breakdown of the phishing tactics present within it. Furthermore, the experimental results are reported as aggregate performance metrics (Accuracy, TPR, FPR, etc.) across the entire test set, with no analysis or reporting of the model's effectiveness against specific, individual tactics.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.2, \"These features are classified into four classes: address bar-based features (category 1), abnormal-based features (category 2), HTML and JavaScript-based features (category 3) and Domain-based features (category 4).\"\n\nPage 9, Table 1, This table lists the 30 features used, which include tactic-specific indicators such as `having_IP_Address`, `SSLfinal_State`, `Prefix_Suffix`, and `having_Sub_Domain`.\n\nPage 10, Section 4.5, The evaluation compares the proposed model against seven other classifiers using aggregate metrics. Table 6 shows overall performance on the test set, but does not stratify the results by phishing tactic."
