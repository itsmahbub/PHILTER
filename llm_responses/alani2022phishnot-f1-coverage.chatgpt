{"value":"Low","why":"PhishNot is evaluated on a generic collection of phishing URLs from PhishTank without any description or categorization of the varied tactics used (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, use of IP‐address URLs, redirect chains). The paper does not report per‐tactic performance or even enumerate which tactics are present in the dataset, indicating that tactic diversity is ignored.","evidence":"Section 4 (Dataset), p. 4: “The original dataset included 111 features extracted for 88,646 URLs. Within these URL instances, 58,000 were labeled ‘benign’, and 30,646 were labeled as ‘phishing’.” (no further breakdown by phishing tactic)"}
