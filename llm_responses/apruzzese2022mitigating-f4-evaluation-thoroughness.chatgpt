{"value":"Medium","why":"The evaluation reports class-sensitive measures such as F1-score and true positive rate (recall), and also false positive rate, but it does not report precision explicitly nor any global summary metric (e.g., AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC). Thus it includes some relevant metrics but lacks full coverage under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 6.2 (No Attack Case), Table 4: columns are “F1-score”, “Acc”, “FPR”, and “TPR” (recall); precision and any AUC/MCC are not reported."}
