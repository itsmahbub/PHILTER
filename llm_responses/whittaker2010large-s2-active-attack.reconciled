{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper includes explicit discussions of manipulation and obfuscation defenses appropriate to its static HTML/URL input modality—e.g. rendering pages in a headless browser to counter script-based cloaking, limiting per-domain training samples to mitigate data-poisoning, and using a large, time-varied dataset for robustness—but it does not include any quantitative evaluation of resistance against diverse evasion techniques nor a breakdown of attack coverage. This aligns with “Medium” (has modality-appropriate defenses but lacks a quantitative, attack-focused evaluation).","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.2.3 (Fetching Page Content): “Rendering the page in a browser ensures that we mimic the environment that the user would experience as much as possible.”\nPage 7, Section 3.4 (Potential Adversarial Attacks): “To combat [data poisoning], we use a large training set collected over a long period of time and limit the number of times a given domain can appear in the training set…” and “Phishers could also try to serve our crawlers non-phishing content different from what they serve their intended victims to escape automatic phishing classifications.”"}
