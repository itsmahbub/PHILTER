{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall, confusion matrix components) and presents precision–recall curves, but it does not compute or report an F1-score or any numeric summary metric such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or Matthews Correlation Coefficient, which are required for a “High” rating under the codebook.","evidence":"Page 11, Section 4.3: Table 9 (‘True Positive Rate/Recall’, ‘Precision’, ‘False Positive Rate’); Figure 4 (‘Precision–recall curves’). No F1-score or AUC-PRC/AUC-ROC/MCC is provided."}
