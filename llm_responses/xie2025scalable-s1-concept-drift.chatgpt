{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed SPWDM model does not implement any adaptive mechanism (e.g., continual learning or periodic retraining) to address evolving phishing tactics, nor does it evaluate temporal generalization by training on earlier‐collected data and testing on later‐collected data. Instead, all datasets (including Crawling2024, which spans four months of collection) are randomly split into training/validation/test sets, assuming static phishing patterns.","evidence":"Page 12, Section 5.2: “All datasets were randomly sampled and divided into training, validation, and test sets at an 8:1:1 ratio.” There is no further evaluation protocol reflecting temporal splits or adaptive updating to handle concept drift."}
