{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not demonstrate any real defenses against evasion or adversarial manipulations within its input modality. Instead of testing with actual manipulated phishing examples (e.g. junk HTML, Base64 scripts, cloaking), the authors only “simulate” bypass by artificially altering model output probabilities. There is no use of adversarial- or evasion-focused datasets, no quantitative breakdown of specific attack types, and no end-to-end evaluation of manipulated inputs. This falls short of even the “Medium” criteria, which requires evaluation on adversarial/evasion-focused data or defense against at least one manipulation type.","evidence":"(p.1 Abstract) “we introduce an innovative methodology for simulating bypass attacks on single-analysis base models”; (p.10 Sec. 5.2.4) “we simulate the bypass by changing the probability prediction of a phishing website... to the probability just below the threshold.” No actual input manipulations or attack coverage statistics are provided."}
