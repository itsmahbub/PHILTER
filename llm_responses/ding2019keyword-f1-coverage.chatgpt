{"value":"Medium","why":"The SHLR method incorporates multiple URL‐based tactics—including detection of IP‐address domains (Rule 5), protocol misuse in non‐protocol fields (Rule 6), top‐level domains in path sections (Rule 7), hidden brand keywords, and character‐level obfuscation through word reorganization—demonstrating coverage of diverse URL‐obfuscation strategies. It also employs DNS‐based ‘doubt’ scoring to capture hosting‐environment risk. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative per‐tactic performance breakdown, nor does it explicitly address homograph attacks or compromised/hosted‐on‐trusted‐shared‐domain scenarios. Therefore, it addresses multiple tactics but lacks tactic‐specific performance reporting.","evidence":"Section 3.2 (Rules 5–7) defines detection for IP domains, protocol field misuse, and TLDs in non‐domain parts. Section 4.2.2 reports overall heuristic rule coverage (Table 9) but does not break down detection rates by each tactic."}
