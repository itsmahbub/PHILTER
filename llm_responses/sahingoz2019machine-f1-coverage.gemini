    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed URL-based method is explicitly designed to address multiple phishing tactics observable in the URL string. The feature engineering process includes dedicated modules and features to detect lexical manipulations like typosquatting (Maliciousness Analysis Module using Levenshtein Distance), the use of random characters (Random Word Detection Module using a Markov Chain Model), and compound word obfuscation (Word Decomposer Module). The final feature set (Table 2) also includes specific features for Punycode (homograph attacks), subdomain count, and the use of special characters, which are all common obfuscation tactics. This demonstrates a clear and thoughtful consideration of tactic diversity in the model's design. However, the evaluation falls short of the 'High' criteria because the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of its evaluation dataset based on these tactics, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. The performance is only reported in aggregate for the phishing class as a whole.",
    "evidence": "Page 7-8, Section 4.5: \"To detect whether the words in the given/tested URLs are used for fraudulent purposes or not, we have implemented a Maliciousness Analysis Module (MAM), which mainly focuses on detection of Typosquatting. Typosquatting is also known as URL hijacking... the similarity of each word is also calculated with the use of Levenshtein Distance, which is also named as Edit Distance algorithm.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 4.4: \"In the phishing URLs, it is seen that some words are formed from random characters. Therefore, it is an efficient way to detect the number of the random words... To detect these words, we implemented the Random Word Detection Module (RWDM)... In the referenced study, the Markov Chain Model was used for the detection of random words.\"\n\nPage 10, Table 2: The list of 'NLP based features' includes features designed to capture specific tactics, such as `Random Word Count`, `Puny Code`, `Special Character (8)`, and `Subdomain Count`.\n\nPage 9, Section 5.5: The evaluation describes using the confusion matrix to calculate aggregate performance metrics like precision, sensitivity, and accuracy. The results presented in Table 4 and Table 5 are for the entire dataset, with no breakdown of performance against different phishing tactics."
