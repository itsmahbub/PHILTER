    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation relies on benign URLs from standard benchmark datasets. The only specific source mentioned for legitimate URLs is Alexa, which is a list of popular, high-reputation domains. The paper provides no evidence that the evaluation datasets were curated to include low-reputation or long-tail domains (e.g., personal sites, small businesses, newly registered domains). Furthermore, while the proposed method uses features like 'brand name matching', the evaluation does not explicitly test the system's robustness against a set of benign pages known to legitimately use brand elements (e.g., PayPal payment buttons, Google login widgets), which is a common cause of false positives. The lack of both specified diversity criteria means the evaluation is limited to high-reputation sites.",
    "evidence": "Page 14, Section 4.4, \"The reason behind this is that the dataset has more common URLs that is extracted from the different sources such as Alexa.\"\n\nPage 8, Table 2, \"Datasets sizes and their sources\": The paper lists the sources for its six datasets (D1-D6) as Kaggle, CatchPhish, and Ebbu2017, referencing other literature. The paper itself does not describe or analyze the composition of the benign URLs within these datasets to confirm diversity beyond referencing popular sources like Alexa.\n\nPage 10, Section 'Brand name-based features', \"We have collected top 500 popular brand names from Alexa.\" This statement, while related to feature engineering, indicates a focus on popular, well-established brands. The paper does not follow up by evaluating how the model performs on legitimate, non-popular sites that might use these brand names correctly."
