    "why": "The paper evaluates its proposed meta-learner models exclusively on a static, pre-existing public dataset (UCI Phishing Websites). This dataset consists of pre-extracted features. The evaluation methodology involves standard 10-fold cross-validation to measure classification performance (accuracy, F-measure, etc.) on this static data. There is no evidence in the paper of testing against active attacks or evasive techniques such as code obfuscation, dynamic content loading (e.g., AJAX), cloaking, or adversarially crafted examples. The method's input is a set of 30 static features, and it lacks the dynamic analysis or rendering capabilities required to observe and defend against such attacks. The evaluation is limited to clean phishing vs. benign examples as represented in the benchmark dataset, without any adversarial or evasive manipulation.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section III.A: \"The phishing website dataset is used in this study as it has been vastly used in existing studies (See Section II). It was developed by Mohammad et al. [15] and available on UCI and Kaggle databases. The phishing website dataset contains 11,055 instances, 30 independent features, and one (1) class attributes...\"\n\nPage 5, Section III.A: \"More importantly, the development of the AI-based meta-learner models was conducted using the N-fold cross-validation technique [19]. In this research work, N was set to 10.\"\n\nPage 4, Figure 1. Overall research methodology: The flowchart depicts a standard machine learning pipeline: Data Source (UCI Dataset) -> Algorithm Implementation -> Model Development (10-fold cross validation) -> Model Evaluation. This flow does not include any steps for dynamic analysis, content rendering, or testing against manipulated inputs, which are necessary to evaluate resistance to active attacks."
