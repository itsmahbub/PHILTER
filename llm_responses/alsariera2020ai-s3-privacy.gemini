    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper focuses exclusively on the offline development and evaluation of machine learning models using a static, pre-existing dataset. It provides no details about a deployment architecture, a real-time inference process, or how user data (such as URLs or webpage content) would be handled in a practical application. The entire experimental setup is centered on training and testing models with 10-fold cross-validation on the UCI Phishing Website dataset. The paper does not describe how the required 30 features would be extracted from a live URL, which is the point where privacy concerns would arise (e.g., sending the URL/content to a server for feature extraction). The authors explicitly state that applying these methods in a real-time environment is a subject for future work, confirming that deployment and its associated privacy implications are outside the scope of this research. According to the codebook, when no inference-time data-handling details or privacy safeguards are described, the rating is 'Low'.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK, \"Conclusively, the application of the implemented methods of this study in a real-time environment remains pivotal future work.\"\n\nPage 4, Section III.A. OVERALL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY, \"The phishing website dataset is used in this study as it has been vastly used in existing studies (See Section II). It was developed by Mohammad et al. [15] and available on UCI and Kaggle databases.\"\n\nPage 7, Section IV.A. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS, \"As earlier stated, the dataset used is the widely used phishing website dataset created by [15]. The method of model development involved the application of 10-fold cross-validation. The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software was used for conducting all experiments...\""
