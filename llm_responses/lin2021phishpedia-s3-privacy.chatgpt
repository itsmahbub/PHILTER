{"value": "Low", "why": "Phishpedia requires sending full URLs (and captured webpage screenshots) from users to an external service for inference and provides no mention of any privacy-preserving measures (e.g., hashing, truncation, or on-device execution). As described in Section 7.2, URLs are routed through a cloud-service link and screenshots are processed off-device in a sandbox, exposing potentially sensitive data.", "evidence": "Page 16, Section 7.2 (Scenario 1): “Every URL in an e-mail is transformed and prefixed with a cloud-service link, so that anytime a user clicks on the link, Phishpedia service in the cloud analyses the URL.”"}
