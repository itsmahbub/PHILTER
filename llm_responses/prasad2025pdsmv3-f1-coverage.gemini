    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed URL-based method explicitly designs features to detect multiple phishing tactics observable in the URL string. These include the use of IP addresses as URLs, lexical manipulations (URL length, use of hyphens), and subdomain spoofing (counting dots). This demonstrates a clear consideration of tactic diversity in the model's design. However, the evaluation lacks the depth required for a 'High' rating. The paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the phishing tactics present in the evaluation datasets, nor does it report the model's detection performance on a per-tactic basis. The evaluation focuses on overall performance metrics across entire datasets rather than analyzing the model's effectiveness against specific attack vectors.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section 3.5, \"URL feature extraction using boosted ConvNeXt architecture\". The paper lists several features that directly map to known phishing tactics: \n- \"Have IP: ...We may determine that a URL is malicious if it includes an IP address. Cybercriminals use IP addresses found in URLs to steal private data.\"\n- \"Length and Depth of URL: Cybercriminals frequently use lengthy URLs to conceal their identity; hence, URLs longer than 54 char are rated as 1 (phishing) or 0 (benign)...\"\n- \"Prefix/ Suffix '- 'in the Domain: Hackers may add the \"-\" to URLs even though they do not contain it; therefore, a value of 1 suggests phishing...\"\n- \"Sub-domain: A website is classified as malicious if the count of \".\" in the URL exceeds 3, and its assigned value is either 1 (phishing) or 0 (benign).\"\n\nThe evaluation section (Pages 9-13, Section 4.3) presents overall performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, F1-Score) across various datasets but does not offer a per-tactic performance breakdown."
