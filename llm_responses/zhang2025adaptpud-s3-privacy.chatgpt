{"value":"Low","why":"AdaptPUD requires the full, unfiltered URL (including path, query string and fragment) to be sent to and processed by the central model at inference time, and the paper does not describe any on-device deployment or privacy-preserving mechanism (e.g. hashed lookups, federated learning, or sanitization).","evidence":"Section 4.2.1 (page 5): “URLs contain both semantic information and structural properties (i.e., scheme, domain, path, query, and fragment)…tokens are combined with their corresponding structural properties” – indicating full URLs (including query parameters) are used; no privacy safeguards are described elsewhere."}
