    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's proposed framework selects Random Forest (RF) as the optimal classifier due to its superior accuracy across multiple datasets. However, the authors explicitly acknowledge that RF is an \"un-interpretable\" model. The research makes no attempt to mitigate this lack of interpretability. There is no mention or application of any post hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) or any other mechanism to provide per-decision reasoning. While an inherently interpretable model like a Decision Tree (J48) was evaluated, it was not the recommended model, and the paper does not discuss exposing its decision paths. The final proposed system functions as a pure black box, providing a classification output without any explanation for its decision.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 3.4: \"Random Forest (RF) ... The drawback is that RF is un-interpretable and may over-fit the dataset when there is noise.\"\nPage 17, Section 5: \"Furthermore, the comparative analysis reveals that RF is the only model that are superior to other models for detection of phishing URLs.\""
