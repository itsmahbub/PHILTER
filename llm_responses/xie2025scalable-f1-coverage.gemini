    "why": "The paper addresses multiple phishing tactics, particularly cloaking/disguise, redirection, and cloned websites. The data collection methodology is explicitly designed to bypass cloaking by using WebDriver to simulate human interaction. The feature engineering process also incorporates specific attributes to detect these tactics, such as a feature for redirection and another to identify when a cloned site's hyperlinks point to external real targets. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of its evaluation dataset by tactic, nor does it report detection performance for each specific tactic. The dataset it creates, Crawling2024, is categorized based on URL structure (prefix/suffix) and access status (successful/failed), not by phishing attack types like homographs or subdomain spoofing. The experimental evaluation reports only aggregate performance metrics, thus not fully demonstrating the model's effectiveness against a diverse range of attack vectors.",
