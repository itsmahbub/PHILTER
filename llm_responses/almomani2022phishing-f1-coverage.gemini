    "why": "The paper's proposed method designs its feature set to explicitly cover a variety of phishing tactics. The features listed in Table 2 and Table 5 are designed to capture signals from common attack vectors such as IP addresses used as hostnames, URL redirection, subdomain spoofing, and HTTPS misuse. For example, features like \"Using the IP Address\", \"Sub Domain and Multi-Sub Domains\", \"Redirecting using '//'\", and \"HTTPS\" directly map to well-known phishing techniques. This demonstrates a clear consideration of tactic diversity at the feature engineering stage. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation datasets by the prevalence of these tactics, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. The results are presented as aggregate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC) across the entire test set, which prevents an analysis of the models' effectiveness against specific types of phishing attacks.",
    "evidence": "page 11, Table 2, \"Semantic Phishing Websites Features selected in our study\": The table lists features that directly address specific phishing tactics. For example: \"1 Using the IP Address\", \"3 Using URL Shortening Services 'TinyURL'\", \"5 Redirecting using '//'\", \"7 Sub Domain and Multi-Sub Domains\", \"8 HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol with Secure Sockets Layer)\". This shows the method considers multiple tactics. However, the results sections (e.g., Table 4 and Table 6) only present overall performance without a per-tactic breakdown."
