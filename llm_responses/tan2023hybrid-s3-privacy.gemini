    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method's core functionality relies on transmitting sensitive data, specifically webpage screenshots (in the form of logo images) and webpage content (as keywords), to multiple external third-party services for analysis. The architecture explicitly queries Google Reverse Image Search, Microsoft Text Recognition (on Bing Visual Search), Google Text Search, and Bing Text Search. Sending image data and textual content extracted from a user's browsing session to external servers without any mentioned privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., hashing, anonymization, or running inference locally) creates a significant privacy risk. This data transmission directly aligns with the criteria for a 'Low' rating, as it sends webpage content and screenshots to external servers for inference.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 3.3.1, \"Querying reverse image search engine with the logo image\": \"Once the logo image is selected, our method queries Google Reverse Image Search to find matching image data from the search engine database.\"\n\nPage 11, Section 3.3.3, \"Querying search engine with visual keywords extracted from the logo image\": \"For this purpose, we employed Microsoft Text Recognition – an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) service hosted on the Bing Visual Search page. ... The textual output from the OCR process forms the keyword set Tid1, which was subsequently fed to Bing Text Search.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 3.3.2, \"Querying search engine with textual keywords\": \"Using Tid4, a regular textual search was invoked on Google Search Engine, and the results were analysed.\"\n\nPage 3, Figure 1, \"Overview of the proposed hybrid identity-based phishing detection technique\": The architectural diagram visually confirms the method's dependency on external services, showing data flows from the system to 'Google Reverse Image Search', 'Bing Text Recognition', 'Google Text Search', and 'Bing Text Search'."
