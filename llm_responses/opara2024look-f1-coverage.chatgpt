{"value":"Medium","why":"WebPhish is designed as a tactic-agnostic, domain-independent detector by learning character-level URL embeddings and word-level HTML embeddings, which in principle can capture a variety of evasion strategies (e.g. homograph attacks, subdomain spoofing, IP-address URLs, lexical manipulations) from raw inputs. However, the paper does not provide any quantitative breakdown of performance by specific phishing tactics, nor does it describe how it handles each tactic class in the evaluation.","evidence":"Page 6 (Section 4.2): “Subsequently, our final corpus contained a balanced dataset of 45,373 phishing and benign instances.” – no tactic labels. Page 8 (Table 3 and Section 5.1): only overall accuracy, precision, recall and F1 are reported, with no per-tactic performance."}
