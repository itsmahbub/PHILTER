    "why": "The paper proposes a model that requires the full URL string as input for feature extraction using tiny-BERT. The methodology describes tokenizing the URL string to create input vectors for the model. However, the paper provides no information on the deployment architecture or how user data would be handled during inference in a real-world scenario. There is no mention of client-side execution, in-boundary deployment (e.g., gateway), or any privacy-preserving techniques such as hashing, URL sanitization, or federated learning. According to the codebook, when no inference-time data handling details are given and no privacy safeguards are described, the rating should be \"Low.\" The default assumption for such a model is that a client would need to send the full, potentially sensitive URL to a server for classification, which poses a privacy risk.",
    "evidence": "page 1, Abstract: \"The core concept is to use tiny-Bert to extract features from website URL strings, and learn the semantic features and long-range dependent features in URLs.\"\npage 4, Section III-A: \"In this article, we tokenize each URL string into a vector of length 100, the length less than 100 is filled with '0.' After the URL text is segmented and mapped into a numeric vector, Bert starts the feature extraction process.\"\nThroughout the paper, there is a complete absence of discussion regarding the model's deployment, client-server architecture, or any mechanisms to protect user privacy during the detection process. The evaluation is conducted entirely offline on a static dataset."
