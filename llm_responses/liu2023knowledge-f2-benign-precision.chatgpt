{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s evaluation of benign pages relies solely on top-ranked Alexa sites and randomly sampled fresh domains, without including targeted low-reputation (long-tail or recently registered) domains or legitimate pages embedding well-known brand elements (e.g., PayPal/OAuth widgets, social media logos). Thus, it lacks both required subsets for high diversity.","evidence":"Page 10, Section 4.2 (“Closed-world Dynamic Dataset … we collected a comparable number (6309) of top Alexa webpages”)"}
