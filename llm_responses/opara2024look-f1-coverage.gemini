    "why": "The paper's proposed method, WebPhish, addresses multiple phishing tactics through its tactic-agnostic design. By learning from raw URL character embeddings and HTML word embeddings, it is not reliant on pre-defined features tied to specific attack vectors. The authors explicitly discuss how the model handles different scenarios, such as spoofed URLs (via misspellings or homographs) and cloned HTML content, demonstrating an awareness of tactic diversity. However, the evaluation lacks the depth required for a 'High' rating. While the dataset is sourced from the real-world repository PhishTank, which likely contains a variety of tactics, the paper provides no quantitative breakdown of the tactics present in the dataset. Consequently, the performance is only reported in aggregate, without any analysis of the model's effectiveness against specific phishing strategies.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 6.2, \"For example, suppose the URL is spoofed by misspelling the characters in the links or by using non-Latin characters to make homographic URLs. Because this proposed approach is trained on a dataset of multi-language websites and uses character embeddings to learn the text's semantic, lexical, and syntactic ambiguities, the model will detect these URL spoofing methods... If the HTML content is cloned word for word, the proposed method will depend on the URL content to determine the maliciousness of the website.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 4.2, \"To train our models, we used real-world datasets from Alexa.com for legitimate web pages and phishtank.com for phishing web pages... our final corpus contained a balanced dataset of 45,373 phishing and benign instances.\" (Note: This section describes the data source and size but provides no analysis of the distribution of phishing tactics within the dataset.)"
