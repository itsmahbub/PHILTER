{"value":"Low","why":"ChatPhishDetector neither incorporates any adaptive strategies (e.g. continual learning, periodic retraining or time-aware feature engineering) nor evaluates its resilience to concept drift via temporally separated train/test splits. The entire dataset was collected over a single period and the system is deployed without any retraining or time-forward evaluation.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “without requiring machine learning model training.” \nPage 6, Section IV.A: “From March to April 2023, we collected URLs from these three sources…” (dataset drawn from a single time window, no temporal evaluation described)"}
