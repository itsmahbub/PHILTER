{"value":"Medium","why":"The evaluation includes a diverse set of long-tail or low-reputation benign sites via Dataset 3 (unpopular sites ranked beyond Alexa 1000 and from DMOZ/BOTW), but does not explicitly test benign pages embedding legitimate third-party brand elements (e.g. PayPal buttons or OAuth widgets). Thus only one of the two required hard subsets is covered.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 3.3 “Dataset 3 … consists of 500 other unpopular legitimate webpages … ranked between 1001 to 5150 in Alexa and 16.4% … not ranked in the Alexa top one million”\n\nNo mention of including benign pages with embedded brand‐element usage in the experimental datasets."}
