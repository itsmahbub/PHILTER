    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation uses essential class-sensitive metrics, explicitly defining and reporting precision, recall, and the F1-score to assess the overall performance of the PhishFencing system. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the need to evaluate performance beyond simple accuracy, which is crucial for the class-imbalanced problem of phishing detection. However, the evaluation does not include any summary metrics like AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC. These metrics are important for providing a single, comprehensive measure of a model's classification quality across all decision thresholds. Because it includes the required class-sensitive metrics but omits a summary metric, the evaluation quality is rated as Medium.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 5.2, Evaluation Metrics: \"The overall performance is measured in terms of precision (P_overall) and recall (R_overall) where [equations for precision and recall are provided]. We also employed the F1-score to combine both precision and recall to evaluate the overall effectiveness of different approaches. The F1-score is defined as: [equation for F1-score is provided].\" The paper proceeds to report results using these metrics, but a review of the entire experimental section confirms the absence of AUC or MCC metrics."
