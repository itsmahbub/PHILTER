    "why": "The proposed method, PhishFencing, is designed as an in-network solution deployed at a secure organizational boundary, such as a gateway or ISP backbone. All core detection processes—traffic interception, page rendering, screenshot analysis, and machine learning inference—are performed within this boundary. For HTTP traffic, all analysis is self-contained. For HTTPS traffic, the system can only access the non-sensitive Server Name Indication (SNI) hostname, not the full URL or page content. While it queries external search engines using this hostname to gather pages for analysis, it does not transmit any user-specific sensitive data (like full URLs with parameters, page content, or screenshots) to an external server for inference. This architecture ensures that the detection process is conducted within the secure perimeter, aligning with the criteria for high privacy preservation.",
    "evidence": "page 2, Section 1: \"PhishFencing will be deployed at primary exit routers of enterprise networks or at the ISPs, to monitor incoming traffic and to block any phishing pages from flowing into the network.\"\npage 9, Section 4.3: \"For HTTPS pages, PhishiFencing could only extract host names from the packets, not the complete URL or any file name/content, hence, PhishFencing cannot directly obtain the corresponding webpages. To (partially) solve this problem, for each host name from the HTTPS streams, PhishFencing searches it on search engines and crawls all the returned URLs within the domain.\"\npage 17, Section 8: \"As a network-based solution, PhishFencing will be deployed at the gateways of enterprise networks or at the ISPs’ network backbones, to block phishing pages from being transmitted to end users.\""
