{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed detection method relies on transmitting full URLs (including domains and possibly query parameters) to external third-party services—WHOIS, Alexa PageRank, and Bing Search—for feature extraction at inference time, without any mention of local-only processing or privacy-preserving mechanisms.
