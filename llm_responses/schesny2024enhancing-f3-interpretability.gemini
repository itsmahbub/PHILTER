    "why": "The proposed method is based on prompting ChatGPT, a large language model that functions as a black box. The authors explicitly acknowledge this limitation in their discussion. Although they structure the output to include a 'phishing score' and other categorical judgments, they state that their analysis cannot determine how these factors are weighted or how they influence the final decision. The paper identifies the need for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques as a future step to address this 'lack of transparency' but does not implement any such methods. Therefore, the system provides no mechanism to explain or audit its predictions.",
    "evidence": "page 2, section III, Results and Discussion, 'The analysis of the results of ChatGPT4 does not reveal which parameters have a strong influence on the phishing score and how the individual weightings of the examined threat patterns are incorporated into the model’s decision. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to analyze possible weaknesses in the model and places the focus on possible Explainable AI (XAI) [7] approaches to make such decisions interpretable for humans.'"
