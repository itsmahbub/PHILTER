    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper demonstrates robustness against a notable subset of active attacks relevant to its dynamic analysis modality, but not a comprehensive set. The authors explicitly evaluate their system's resilience to two specific types of attacks in Section 9 (RQ4): adversarial perturbations on screenshot-based components (submission button detection) and HTML code obfuscation targeting input field recognition heuristics. The system's core design also inherently addresses evasions like malicious redirects post-credential submission and deferred execution (requiring form interaction to trigger malicious behavior). However, the authors explicitly state that their method does not address advanced cloaking techniques, a significant class of active evasion. This evaluation against a partial but not complete set of relevant attacks warrants a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 9.1, Setup: \"In the DynaPhish design, the attack surface mainly lies in (1) the webpage screenshots which can be constructed to fool the deep object detector in DynaPhish to report the submission button (see Section 3.3.1) and (2) the HTML heuristics used by DynaPhish to fill in the fake verifiable credentials. Thus, we design two adversaries in this experiment... First, we used the Dense Adversary Generation (DAG) attack [62] to generate adversarial attacks on the input screenshot... Second, we generated an adversary for HTML code obfuscation to compromise the HTML heuristics used by DynaPhish for verifiable account information...\"\n\nPage 15, Section 11, Limitations and Future Work: \"Moreover, our interaction does not address the advanced cloaking techniques [26, 37, 45]. With client-side cloaking (Figure 12), phishing can bypass many anti-phishing solutions [47,48].\""
