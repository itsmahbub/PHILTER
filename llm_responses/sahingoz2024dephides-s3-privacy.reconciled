{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not specify any deployment or inference-time data handling that would keep raw URLs on the client device or otherwise avoid transmitting sensitive URL data externally. There is no mention of on-device inference, hashing, federated learning, or any other privacy-preserving mechanism. Under the codebook, this lack of detail about where and how URLs are processed at inference time falls squarely into the “Low” category.","evidence":"Section VI.C (Real-Time Execution) describes throughput performance (‘The proposed system can classify over 130,070 URLs per second, making it suitable for deployment in high-traffic environments’) but does not indicate whether inference occurs locally or requires sending full URLs to a remote service. No other section of the paper details client-side deployment or privacy safeguards at inference time."}
