{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper implements and evaluates robustness against client-side and server-side disguises (cloaking) within its data acquisition modality by using a WebDriver-based collector that simulates human interactions to bypass cloaking. However, it does not evaluate or defend against other active attacks—such as obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, deferred execution, or adversarial perturbations—within its claimed input scope. Thus, it shows partial but not comprehensive resilience.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 3.2: “A collector was then built using SeleniumWire to circumvent client-side or server-side disguises … human interactions within the browser, such as scrolling and clicking actions, are simulated.” \nPage 15, Section 6.4: “Despite employing methods to mitigate client-side and server-side disguises, our analysis of the captured data revealed that a small portion still exhibited disguise.”"}
