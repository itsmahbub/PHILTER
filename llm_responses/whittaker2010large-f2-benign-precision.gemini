    "why": "The evaluation's benign dataset is constructed in a way that inherently includes low-reputation and long-tail domains, fulfilling one of the two criteria for high diversity. The system sources its URLs from Gmail's spam filters and user submissions, and then explicitly filters out a whitelist of 2,778 high-profile, high-traffic websites. The remaining benign pages are described as \"already quite suspect,\" indicating they are not the typical, easy-to-classify popular sites. However, the paper does not mention any specific effort to include or test against the second diversity criterion: benign pages that make legitimate use of third-party brand elements (e.g., payment widgets, social media logins). While the dataset's source in spam may incidentally include such pages, it is not a stated methodological goal or a distinct subset used in the evaluation to measure robustness against such specific false positive triggers.",
    "evidence": "page 8, section 4.1, \"As described in Section 3.2.1, the only URLs analyzed are either submitted as a potential phishing page or collected from a spam email. From these, URL feature extraction filters out approximately half of the pages as either invalid or whitelisted (see Section 3.2.2.) The majority of these filtered pages are URLs for high profile domains added to spam emails to enhance their appearance of legitimacy. The remaining pages in the training sets are already quite suspect. However, most of these pages are not phishing.\"\n\npage 4, section 3.2.2, \"First, if the URL is improperly constructed or if it matches a whitelist of high profile, safe sites, then the URL Feature Extractor drops the URL from the workflow entirely. We manually compile this whitelist of 2778 sites, requiring that each site both have high traffic and not host arbitrary user-generated content.\""
