{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation’s benign set is limited to high-reputation, popular sites (Tranco top-50 k domains) and does not include low-reputation/long-tail domains nor benign pages with legitimate brand elements. Thus it fails to test diversity in benign pages and likely underestimates false positive rates on harder cases.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 6.1 “TR-OP: … benign samples are randomly collected from Tranco [46] top 50 k domains …”"}
