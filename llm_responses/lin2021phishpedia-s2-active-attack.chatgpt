{"value":"Medium","why":"Phishpedia demonstrates robustness against a class of active attacks observable in its screenshot modality—namely, gradient-based adversarial perturbations on both its object‐detection (Faster‐RCNN) and Siamese logo‐matching models—but does not evaluate defenses against other common evasions (e.g. deferred execution, cloaking, dynamic content loading) within its input scope. Thus, it shows partial robustness, but not across the full attack surface of visual‐modal phishing evasions.","evidence":"Section 3.3 (page 7): “we also incorporate a gradient masking technique on to Phishpedia to counter adversarial attacks.”; Section 5.6.1 (page 12–13): Tables 5–6 report that original model accuracy drops from 59.6 mAP to 12.9 under DAG and from 93.5% logo‐match to near zero under FGSM/JSMA, whereas the transformed (step‐ReLU) models retain ~58.7 mAP and 93.5% logo‐match accuracy, respectively."}
