{"value":"Low","why":"The paper focuses exclusively on adversarial robustness of machine-learning classifiers via feature mapping, without any consideration of the wide range of real-world phishing tactics or evaluation across tactic categories. No per-tactic dataset breakdown or performance reporting is provided, and the method is not designed or evaluated to detect specific tactics (e.g., homograph URLs, subdomain spoofing, shared domains, IP-based hosts, brand impersonation).","evidence":"Table 2 lists only generic URL/HTML features (page 4) and nowhere in the paper do the authors categorize phishing samples by tactic or report detection results per tactic; e.g., no sections or tables address different phishing tactics or provide a quantitative breakdown of tactics in the evaluation datasets."}
