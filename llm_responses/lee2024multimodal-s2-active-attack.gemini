    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper dedicates a specific section (Section VII) to evaluating the system's robustness against active attacks. The evaluation is performed against two distinct and relevant types of adversarial attacks sourced from prior research: (1) webpage source perturbations, which involve semantic and content-level manipulations like altering images and introducing typos in brand names, and (2) adversarial noise generated to specifically mislead computer vision models that analyze logos. The proposed LLM-based system demonstrates exceptional resilience to both attack methodologies, correctly identifying the brand in nearly all perturbed samples. This comprehensive testing against a diverse set of active attacks (semantic content changes and targeted adversarial noise) within the system's visual input modality fulfills the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section VII, 'ROBUSTNESS AGAINST ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS': \"We examine the effectiveness of the adversarial attack against LLMs with the same image datasets that are used by these studies [18], [42].\"\n\nPage 11, Section VII-A: The paper describes the two attack types tested. For the first: \"Adversarial Attack 1 — Webpage source perturbation: Yuan et al. introduce four webpage source perturbation techniques in their study [42] ... altering the background image, modifying the footer image, introducing typos in brand name text, and unveiling the password form.\" For the second: \"Adversarial Attack 2 — Noise perturbation on Logo: Based on the observation that most recent visual-based brand identification solutions rely heavily on the logo image... Lee et al. focused on perturbing the logos of popular webpages using generative models.\"\n\nPage 11, Table IV, 'Brand identification against adversarial samples': This table provides quantitative results showing high robustness. Against webpage source perturbations, GPT and Claude achieve 100% accuracy (133/133 correct). Against noise on logos, they achieve over 97% accuracy (e.g., Claude: 147/150 correct)."
