    "why": "The paper proposes a multi-modal framework using textual, visual, graph, and temporal features, making it inherently generalizable and not reliant on specific, hard-coded phishing tactics. The authors demonstrate a strong consideration for tactic diversity by explicitly evaluating their model's robustness against a range of common adversarial techniques. They test against URL obfuscation, content morphing, script injection, visual obfuscations (image distortions, transparent overlays), URL cloaking (dynamic redirects, homographs), and HTML obfuscation. Furthermore, they test the model's generalization ability on diverse phishing campaigns, including AI-generated scams and deepfake-based pages. However, the paper does not meet the criteria for a 'High' rating because it lacks a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation datasets by tactic prevalence and does not report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. All performance metrics are aggregated.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section IV, \"Upon testing, it was found that the application of adversarial perturbation methods (like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)) later caused a drop in phishing detection by 7.8%, showing susceptibility to adversarially targeted phishing pages.\"\nPage 12, Section IV, \"Visual obfuscations (image distortions, transparent overlays), URL cloaking (dynamic redirects, homographs), and HTML obfuscation (invisible form fields, script injections) represent common adversarial techniques in phishing.\"\nPage 11, Section IV, \"Adversarial robustness was tested by using adversarial phishing samples and obfuscating URLs, morphing content, and injecting scripts. The models then received an F1-score of 0.92.\"\nPage 13, Section IV, \"The framework's generalization ability was tested on an expanded set, which included financial phishing attacks, AI generative scam websites, and deepfake-based phishing pages from alternative sources such as Emerging Threats Open, VirusTotal, and darknet phishing repositories.\""
