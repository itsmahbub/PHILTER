{"value":"High","why":"The paper reports all required class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall, F1‐score) and includes a summary metric (ROC‐AUC). This comprehensive set of performance measures—particularly precision and recall alongside F1‐score and ROC‐AUC—ensures evaluation under class‐imbalance conditions is meaningful and complete.","evidence":"Page 2, Section I-A: “the hybrid model achieves … 97.8% precision, 96.7% recall, and an AUC score of 0.97.”; Page 13, Table 4: lists Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1‐Score and ROC‐AUC for each model."}
