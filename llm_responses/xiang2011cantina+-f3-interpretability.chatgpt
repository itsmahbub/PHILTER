{"value":"Low","why":"The paper describes CANTINA+ as a layered filtering and black-box machine learning framework (Bayesian networks) without any mechanism for exposing per-decision explanations, decision paths, or applying post hoc XAI techniques. There is no discussion of how individual feature contributions are presented to users or analysts, nor any inherently transparent model (e.g., decision tree) whose path can be traced.","evidence":"Section 6.2 (Machine Learning Algorithms): “We compare six learning algorithms… We found through extensive experiment that BN performed among the best algorithms consistently. … Therefore, we only report the performance of BN in this article.”  No further mention is made of exposing decision paths or providing explanations (see entire paper)."}
