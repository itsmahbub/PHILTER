    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper exclusively details the training and offline evaluation of machine learning models on a static, pre-collected dataset. It does not propose or describe any deployment architecture for how the detection method would be used in a real-world, user-facing scenario (e.g., in a browser, email client, or network gateway). There is no mention of whether feature extraction and model inference would occur locally on the client's device or on a remote server. The paper makes no reference to any privacy-preserving techniques, such as URL hashing, federated learning, or anonymized feature vectors. According to the metric's criteria, when \"no inference-time data-handling details are given,\" the privacy preservation level is considered low.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3, Figure 2: The methodology and accompanying figure illustrate a standard offline machine learning workflow: a static 'Phishing Dataset' is pre-processed, split into training and testing sets, used to train algorithms, and then a 'Final Prediction' is made for evaluation. This entire process describes model development, not a real-time deployment architecture. \n\nPage 15, Section 5, Conclusion and future work: The paper states a goal for future work is \"(iii) allowing the model to be used in real-time while reducing its run time.\" This confirms that the design and implementation of a real-time, deployable system is outside the scope of the current research presented. The paper does not provide any details on how user data would be handled during such a real-time application."
