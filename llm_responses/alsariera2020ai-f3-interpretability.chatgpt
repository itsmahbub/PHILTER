{"value":"Low","why":"The paper presents black-box ensemble models (meta-learners over Extra-Trees) for phishing detection but does not include any mechanism for explaining individual predictions or exposing decision paths. There is no mention of post hoc XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP/LIME) nor of extracting feature importances or generating per-instance explanations.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “AI-based phishing countermeasures or methods possess their shortcomings particularly ... the inability to interpret how most phishing methods perform their function.”  Page 8, Section IV.B: Evaluation uses only “Accuracy, False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN) and F-measure” with no reference to interpretability or explanation methods."}
