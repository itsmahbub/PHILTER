{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any deployment or data-handling mechanisms that would keep sensitive URL or content data on the user’s device or within a secure boundary. There is no mention of hashing URLs, federated learning, anonymized feature extraction, or truncating query parameters—only standard offline model training and real-time applicability are discussed, implying raw feature transmission off-device or no privacy safeguards.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “As a result, the proposed approach would be practical in both offline and real-time applications.” – No privacy mechanisms described\nPage 5 (Section 3, Methodology/Fig. 2): Presents a generic pipeline from user data to external model inference with no client-side or in-boundary deployment or data sanitization mentioned"}
