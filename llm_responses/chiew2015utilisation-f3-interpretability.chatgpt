{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed method’s core decision logic (logo-based Google search followed by domain-name matching) is inherently transparent and follows a clear, interpretable rule path. However, it does not provide per-instance explanations (e.g. feature attributions or heatmaps), nor does it expose the internal decision process of its SVM-based logo detector via XAI techniques. Thus, it offers limited, global interpretability without per-decision traceability.","evidence":"Section 3.2 (page 5): “If the comparisons return at least one match, our method will classify the query website as legitimate. Otherwise, it is classified as a phishing website.”  Section 3.1 (page 4): “We deliberately selected support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier … changing to an optimal classifier later is effortless.”"}
