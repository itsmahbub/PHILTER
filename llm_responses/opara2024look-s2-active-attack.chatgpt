{"value":"Low","why":"WebPhish is evaluated solely on static, clean phishing and benign pages drawn from Alexa and PhishTank. The paper does not include any experiments or analysis measuring its resilience against obfuscation tactics (e.g. junk HTML, invisible elements, obfuscated scripts), dynamic evasions (AJAX, deferred execution), cloaking, or adversarially perturbed examples within its URL/HTML modality.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 4.2: “we collated a balanced dataset of 45,373 phishing and benign instances.” No subsequent sections describe testing against manipulated or evasive content."}
