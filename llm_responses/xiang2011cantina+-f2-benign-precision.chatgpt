{"value":"Low","why":"The benign dataset consists solely of high‐reputation or popular sites (e.g. Alexa top‐100 English sites, generic banks from Yahoo directory, common phishing targets) and does not include long‐tail or low‐reputation domains nor explicitly include pages with legitimate brand widgets or embedded logos. Thus the evaluation lacks both required subsets for diversity.","evidence":"Section 7.2 Web Page Corpus (page 12): “Our legitimate collection mainly focuses on popular sites, commonly spammed sites, common phishing target sites… Table I: Top 100 English sites, 3Sharp, Generic banks, Other Yahoo directory categories, Most common phishing targets.”"}
