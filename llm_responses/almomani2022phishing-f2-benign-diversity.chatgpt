{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluations use benign pages drawn from popular, high-reputation sources (e.g. Alexa top sites, Popular Crawl) and do not include any mention of low-reputation or long-tail domains nor pages featuring legitimate brand elements such as PayPal/OAuth widgets or social media buttons. Thus, the false positive rate is assessed only on “easy” cases and lacks the required diversity.","evidence":"Page 15, Section 4.2: “Legitimate web pages: Alexa, Popular Crawl, anti-phishing investigators…”; Page 10, Section 4.1: datasets are drawn from PhishTank, MillerSmiles and Google queries with no inclusion of low-reputation or brand-element-bearing benign pages."}
