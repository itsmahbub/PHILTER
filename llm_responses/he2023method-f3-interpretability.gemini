    "why": "The proposed model is a classic example of a 'black box' system. It uses a tiny-Bert model for feature extraction from URLs and then feeds these features into a stacked ensemble of complex models (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and GBDT). Both transformers (like Bert) and gradient boosting ensembles are inherently non-transparent. The paper makes no mention of employing any methods to provide interpretability, such as post hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME), visualizing the Bert model's attention weights, or exposing decision paths. The research focuses entirely on achieving high performance metrics (accuracy, recall, speed), and does not discuss, evaluate, or provide any mechanism for explaining why a specific URL is classified as phishing.",
    "evidence": "Page 3, Section III, OUR METHODOLOGY: \"The model is divided into two parts, one is to use tiny-Bert to extract URL string features, and the other is to build a Stacking model for detecting phishing websites.\" and Page 4, Section III-B: \"The Stacking algorithm designed in this article consists of three first level learners, namely: 1) gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost) [24]; 2) extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) [25]; and 3) light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) [26], while its second level learner is based on gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) [27] learner.\" This description outlines a multi-stage, complex architecture with no mention of interpretability. The entire paper lacks any section or discussion on explaining the model's predictions."
