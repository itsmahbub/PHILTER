{"value": "Low",  
 "why": "The proposed framework relies exclusively on deep neural models (RNN, GRU, LSTM) without offering any mechanism for per‐decision explanations, feature attributions, or inherently interpretable decision rules. There is no mention of post hoc XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention‐based heatmaps) nor any presentation of global or local feature importances. As a result, the method behaves as a black‐box with no auditability or transparency of its classification decisions.",  
 "evidence": "Across all technical sections (e.g., Section III.B ‘Modelling’ and Section V ‘Evaluation Results’), the paper describes model architectures, training, and performance metrics but makes no reference to explainability, feature importance analysis, or interpretability techniques. For example, Section III.B.4 (‘Modelling’) details the RNN/GRU/LSTM structures but does not discuss any interpretability or explanation methods."}
