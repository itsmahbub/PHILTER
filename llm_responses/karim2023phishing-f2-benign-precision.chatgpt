Thus, it fails to cover the two harder benign subsets required for a ‘Medium’ or ‘High’ rating and is limited to standard popular sites.","evidence":"Page 8, Section III.A: “The dataset was collected in a CSV file from the well-known dataset repository called Kaggle… The dataset consisted of 11054 number of records and 33 attributes… The dataset consisted of two classes: phishing and legitimate.”"}
