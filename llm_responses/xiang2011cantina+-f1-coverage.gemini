    "why": "The method proposes a comprehensive set of 15 features explicitly designed to address a variety of phishing tactics. The feature set covers URL-based obfuscation (IP addresses as domains, embedded domains in paths, out-of-position TLDs), lexical manipulations (suspicious characters like '@', hyphens), hosting on newly registered domains (age of domain), and misuse of web forms (non-HTTPS form actions). The design also includes several tactic-agnostic features based on web reputation (PageRank, presence in search engine results), which can help detect phishing on compromised legitimate domains. However, while the paper considers this diversity in its design and feature analysis, the evaluation section does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the dataset by tactic, nor does it report detection performance for each specific tactic. The evaluation's primary distinction is between 'unique' and 'near-duplicate' phish, which reflects content similarity from toolkits rather than the underlying attack vector.",
    "evidence": "Page 8-10, Section 6.1, High-Level Web Page Features: The paper details numerous features targeting specific tactics:\n- **(2) IP address:** \"This feature checks if a page’s domain name is an IP address.\"\n- **(1) Embedded domain:** \"This feature examines the presence of dot separated domain/hostname patterns such as 'www.ebay.com' in the path part of the Web page URL.\"\n- **(6) Out-of-position top level domain (TLD):** \"This feature checks if a TLD appears in an unusual position in the URL.\"\n- **(11) Age of domain:** \"This feature checks the age of the Web page domain name via WHOIS lookups. Many phishing sites are hosted on recently registered domains...\"\n- **(7) Bad forms:** Checks for sensitive forms with \"a non-https scheme in the URL in the action field...\"\n\nPage 15, Section 8.3.2, Table IV: The evaluation results are aggregated and do not offer a per-tactic breakdown. The table categorizes performance based on the \"Type of phish in the testing set,\" with the categories being \"Unique\" and \"Near-duplicate,\" not specific attack tactics like IP-based URLs or subdomain spoofing."
