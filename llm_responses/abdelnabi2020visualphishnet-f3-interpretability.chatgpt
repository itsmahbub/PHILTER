{"value":"Low","why":"VisualPhishNet is a purely black‐box deep‐learning approach: it learns an embedding via a triplet CNN and classifies pages solely by thresholding embedding distances. The paper does not propose or apply any inherently interpretable model (e.g. decision trees) nor any post hoc XAI techniques (e.g. LIME, SHAP, heatmaps) to explain individual decisions, so there is no per‐decision traceability or feature‐level insight.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 5.3 Prediction: “we use the shared network to compute the embeddings then we compute the L₂ distance … if the minimum distance … is smaller than a defined threshold, the page would be classified as a phishing page; otherwise … legitimate.” No mechanism for explaining which visual cues drove that decision is described."}
