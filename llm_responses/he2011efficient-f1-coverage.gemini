    "why": "The proposed method explicitly addresses multiple phishing tactics through its feature engineering. Specific features are designed to detect the use of IP addresses in URLs (F1), subdomain spoofing via excessive dots (F10), and HTTPS misuse by comparing the certificate's domain with the page's URL (F9). Furthermore, the core 'identity extraction' mechanism, which compares textual content (term identity) and hyperlink structure (URL identity) against the page's actual domain, is a general approach for detecting brand impersonation on unrelated, untrusted, or compromised domains (F2, F4, F6). While the method demonstrates coverage of multiple tactics in its design, the evaluation section falls short of the 'High' criteria. The paper describes the sources of its evaluation dataset (e.g., PhishTank, CastleCops) but does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the specific phishing tactics present within the dataset, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis.",
    "evidence": "Page 12022-12023, Section 4: The paper defines features that explicitly target different tactics:\n- Tactic: IP address as URL / User info spoofing: \"We use F1 to denote Feature 1 for the suspicious page address. If the URL of a webpage is in an irresolvable IP address form or there is a user info part, then F1 = 1, otherwise F1 = 0.\" (Section 4.1)\n- Tactic: General impersonation on unrelated domain: \"We use F2 to denote Feature 2 for the ID page address. If the URL identity is different with the base domain of the page address, then F2 = 1, else proceed with the base domain URL to term identity set comparison. If one of the term identity set is a substring of the base domain then F2 = 0; otherwise, F2 = 1.\" (Section 4.2)\n- Tactic: HTTPS misuse: \"F9 is used to denote the SSL certificate feature. If the URL of the certificate is different with the page address URL then F9 = +1.\" (Section 4.9)\n- Tactic: Subdomain spoofing: \"The URL address of a phishing page may have many dots to confuse users... F10 is used to denote this feature and its value is simply the number of dots in the URL address.\" (Section 4.10)\n\nPage 12025, Section 5.1: The evaluation describes the dataset's origin but lacks a breakdown by tactic: \"For the phishing pages, most of the 325 pages were collected from CastleCops phishing database and few of them from PhishTank.\""
