{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates its URL‐based detection method only on standard benchmark datasets of clean phishing and benign URLs, with no testing against any active or adversarial evasion techniques (e.g. inserted junk characters, cloaking, deferred execution, adversarial URL perturbations) within its URL modality.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “The experiments are carried out on six different datasets using eight different machine learning classifiers…” ; Page 13 (Section 4 Experiments): all evaluations are on unmodified benchmark datasets, with no mention of adversarial or evasive manipulation tests."}
