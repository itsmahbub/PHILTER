    "why": "The paper evaluates the proposed URL-based phishing detector, PhishNot, exclusively on standard, non-adversarial datasets. The entire experimental methodology involves training and testing on curated lists of known phishing and benign URLs. There is no mention of experiments designed to test the system's resilience against active attacks relevant to its input modality (URL analysis). For instance, the authors do not evaluate the model against adversarially crafted URLs designed to cause misclassification, nor do they test against sophisticated URL obfuscation techniques intended to evade feature-based detection. The evaluation benchmarks are limited to clean phishing vs. benign examples without any adversarial or evasive manipulation. While the paper acknowledges the sophistication of phishing, its evaluation does not address this aspect through robustness testing.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 4, The dataset: \"The dataset chosen to train and test our models was the one introduced in [22]. The dataset was built by collecting data about well-known phishing URLs from PhishTank [23] and benign URLs from Alexa [24].\" This confirms the use of standard, non-adversarial benchmark datasets for evaluation.\n\nPage 6, Section 5.4, Initial model training: \"The data was split into two parts; 75% used for training and 25% used for testing. This random split considers the balance of the two classes when creating the two subsets.\" This describes a standard ML evaluation protocol on a static dataset, which does not involve testing against active or adaptive attacks.\n\nPage 7, Section 5.7, Validation using a second dataset: \"To further validate the generalization of our proposed model, we conducted additional training and testing using the dataset from [10]. This dataset contains 73,575 URLs (36,400 benign and 37,175 phishing).\" The validation aims to confirm generalization across different clean datasets, not robustness to attacks.\n\nPage 10, Table 6, Comparison of performance measures of PhishNot with other research: The comparative analysis focuses solely on standard metrics like Accuracy, FP, and FN on benchmark datasets, without any discussion or results related to performance under attack conditions."
