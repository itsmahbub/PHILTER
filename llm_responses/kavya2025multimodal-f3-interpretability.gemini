    "value": "High",
    "why": "The proposed framework, specifically the TGNN-Att (Temporal Graph Neural Network with Attention) component, integrates a self-attention mechanism that provides per-decision explanations. This mechanism calculates attention weights for individual webpage components (nodes) over time, directly indicating which elements are most influential in the classification decision. The paper provides concrete examples of these attention weights for specific components like hyperlinks and logos, linking them to the final phishing probability. This ability to trace a prediction back to the importance of specific input features fulfills the criteria for a high level of interpretability.",
    "evidence": "Page 15, Table 9, \"Temporal graph neural network with attention (Tgnn-Att) node-level temporal analysis.\": This table explicitly shows an \"Attention Weight\" column, assigning a numerical importance score to specific webpage components (nodes) at different time intervals. For instance, 'Hyperlink 1' has an attention weight of 0.80 and later 0.85, corresponding to high phishing probabilities.\nPage 7, Section III, Equations (6)-(8): These equations mathematically define the self-attention mechanism used for temporal propagation. The text states, \"For each node i, the attention weight between node i and its neighbor j is computed via equations (6), (7), and (8).\"\nPage 2, Section A, Motivation and Contribution: \"The contributions of this work are: ... (2) the use of attention mechanisms improves the identification of critical changes in evolving phishing behaviors...\" This highlights that attention is a core, deliberate feature of the model design for identifying key signals."
