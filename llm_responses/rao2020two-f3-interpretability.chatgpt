{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed approach relies on black-box ensemble classifiers (Random Forest, Extra-Tree, XGBoost) and fuzzy hashing without any per-decision explanations (e.g. SHAP/LIME) or even global feature‐importance summaries. There is no mechanism for tracing individual classification decisions or auditing which features drove a particular outcome.","evidence":"Section 3.2 & Experiment 3: “These features are fed to deep learning algorithms such as … Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine …” and “We designed an ensemble model combining RF, XGBoost and Extra-Tree classifiers to increase the detection accuracy.” Nowhere do the authors apply or report any XAI techniques or expose decision paths for interpretability."}
