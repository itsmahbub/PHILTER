    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method explicitly addresses a variety of phishing tactics through its feature engineering process. The features are designed to detect specific attack vectors such as using IP addresses in URLs, HTTPS misuse, subdomain spoofing through excessive dots, lexical manipulations (e.g., typosquatting detected with Levenshtein distance), and URL redirection. This demonstrates a clear consideration for tactic diversity within the URL and HTML modalities. However, the evaluation falls short of the 'High' criteria because the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the tactics present in its evaluation datasets (e.g., 50K-PD), nor does it report the model's detection performance on a per-tactic basis. The results are only presented as aggregate performance metrics.",
    "evidence": "The paper details features designed to counter multiple tactics:\n- **IP Address Tactic**: \"In practice, the domain names of phishing webpages usually are the IP address... A binary value is used to indicate whether the domain name of a URL is an IP address or not.\" (Page 3, Section 3.1.1 (1))\n- **HTTPS Misuse**: \"Applying “https\" on personal webpage needs to apply to a professional agency, thus phishing webpages usually do not apply \"https\". A binary value is used to indicate whether the protocol of a URL is \"https\" or not.\" (Page 3, Section 3.1.1 (3))\n- **Subdomain Spoofing**: \"Rami et al. observed that phishing webpages tended to use more dots in their URLs... The number of ‘.’ in domain name is used to represent this feature.\" (Page 3, Section 3.1.1 (5))\n- **Lexical Manipulation (Typosquatting)**: \"Therefore, we propose to discover the behavior that mimics target webpages in the URLs and take it as a feature... we calculate the Levenshtein distance [40] between each string and a given target brand from Phishtank...\" (Page 3, Section 3.1.1 (8))\n- **Redirection**: \"Some phishing webpages designers create legitimate webpages for users to access, which will redirect to phishing ones. The redirected phishing webpages use “redirect” string in the HTML codes. A binary value is used to indicate whether there exists such a string.\" (Page 4, Section 3.1.2 (6))\n\nThe evaluation section (Section 4) presents overall performance metrics (e.g., Table 3, page 8) but lacks any analysis of performance against these specific tactics."
