{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class‐sensitive metrics—Precision and Sensitivity (Recall)—but does not include F1‐score or any of the summary metrics recommended for imbalanced classification (AUC‐PRC, AUC‐ROC, or MCC). It only reports Accuracy and Error rate, which are not sufficient under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 17, Section 5.1 (Table 4): reports Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, Accuracy, Error rate; no F1‐score or AUC/MCC values are given."}
