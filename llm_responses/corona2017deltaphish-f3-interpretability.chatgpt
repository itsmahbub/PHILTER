{"value":"Medium","why":"DeltaPhish provides global insight into its decision logic by exposing feature importances (e.g. the linear SVM weights for its 11 HTML‐based features, shown in Figure 8), but does not offer per‐decision explanations or apply post‐hoc XAI techniques to trace individual classifications. There is no mechanism (e.g. LIME, SHAP or heatmaps) to explain why a specific page was flagged.","evidence":"Section 3.2: “We then train a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)… The feature weights w1 ∈ R^d1 and the bias b1 ∈ R of the classification function are optimized during SVM learning.”\nFigure 8 (page 15): “Boxplot of feature weights (and bias) for the HTML‐based classifier.”"}
