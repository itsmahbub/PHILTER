{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method uses a generic 30-feature phishing website dataset (UCI Phishing Website Dataset) and treats phishing detection as a binary classification problem. It does not discuss or target specific phishing tactics (e.g. subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, URL redirection, hosting on compromised or shared domains, IP-based URLs, brand impersonation), nor does it provide any per-tactic breakdown of performance. Thus it ignores the diversity of real-world phishing tactics.","evidence":"Section 4.2 (Data set description): “We adopt dataset named Phishing website dataset come from the UCI repository. This dataset collect mainly from PhishTank archive… consists of 11,055 samples which have 30 features pre-classified as phishing and benign.”  No sections address phishing tactics or report per-tactic results."}
