    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation is conducted exclusively on a standard, static dataset (UCI Phishing Websites). This dataset consists of pre-collected phishing and benign samples with pre-defined features. The experimental methodology focuses on optimizing the model's hyperparameters and comparing its classification performance (e.g., accuracy, FPR) against other standard machine learning models on a clean train-test split of this dataset. There is no evidence that the authors tested their method against active attacks or evasive techniques. The evaluation does not include samples with obfuscated URLs, manipulated JavaScript, junk HTML, or other adversarial modifications designed to bypass detectors. While the paper claims the model can \"quickly detect new phishing websites (zero hour attack)\", this is framed in the context of generalizing beyond a blacklist, not resisting deliberate evasion. The evaluation lacks any form of adversarial or active testing.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.2, Data set description: \"We adopt dataset named Phishing website dataset come from the UCI repository. This dataset collect mainly from PhishTank archive, MillerSmiles archive and Google's searching operators. The dataset is consisted of 11,055 samples which have 30 features pre-classified as phishing and benign. In our experiment, we split our dataset to 20% for testing and 80% for training by stratified random sampling method.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 4.5, Comparable Results: \"In order to evaluate our proposed model, we compare the performance of the proposed model with seven statistical and machine learning classifier model trained and tested on the same datasets and platform.\" This section, along with Table 6, confirms that the entire comparative evaluation is performed on the same static dataset without any mention of adversarial manipulation."
