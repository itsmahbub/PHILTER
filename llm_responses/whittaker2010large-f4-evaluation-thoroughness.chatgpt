{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics—precision and recall—and provides confusion matrix values and precision–recall curves, but it does not report an F1-score nor any summary metric such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or Matthews Correlation Coefficient","evidence":"Page 11, Section 4.3: Table 9 (‘True Positive Rate/Recall’, ‘Precision’, ‘False Positive Rate’); Figure 4 (precision–recall curves). No F1-score or summary metric is presented."}
