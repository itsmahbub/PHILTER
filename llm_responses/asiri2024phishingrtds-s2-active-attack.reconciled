{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper explicitly addresses and evaluates robustness against two structural evasion techniques within its URL‐based scope—TinyURL resolution via the browser extension and Browser-in-the-Browser attacks by scraping and classifying all iframe-embedded URLs in static HTML/JavaScript. However, it does not evaluate or discuss defenses against other active evasions (e.g. dynamic content loading, cloaking, obfuscated JavaScript, adversarial perturbations), so its coverage is limited to a subset of relevant attacks.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “we design a system that detects three types of phishing attacks: TinyURLs, Browsers in the Browser (BiTB), and regular phishing attacks.”\nPage 4, Section 3.1.1: “Once a user clicks on a URL, the extension extracts the original webpage’s URL. This step protects the user from TinyURL attacks.”\nPage 5, Section 3.2: “Since the BiTB attacks use IFrame, we propose scrapping all URLs inside the webpage … Frame source such as … IFrame …” – no mention of dynamic or adversarial evasions.
