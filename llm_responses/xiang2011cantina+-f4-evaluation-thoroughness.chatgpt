{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics (true positive rate as recall, false positive rate, and F1-score) and a summary metric (area under the ROC curve), but does not explicitly report precision. Therefore it lacks full metric coverage as defined by the codebook.","evidence":"Section 7.1 (Evaluation Metrics): “we adopted true positive rate and false positive rate … We also used the F1 measure … we adopted … area under the ROC curve (AUC)” ; Table IV: reports TP, FP, and F1 but no precision."}
