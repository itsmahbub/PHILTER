{"value":"Medium","why":"ChatPhishDetector is designed to detect a variety of real-world phishing tactics—including social engineering techniques (fake malware warnings, urgent payment requests, rewards), brand impersonation, and domain squatting—by using domain-independent, tactic-agnostic prompts. However, although the paper demonstrates overall high performance, it does not present a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation dataset by tactic nor report per-tactic detection results.","evidence":"Section III-B (Prompt Engineering): “Analyze whether the website contains SE techniques… typical SE techniques… cash prizes, fake malware infection warnings, account problems, and postal parcel issues.”; Section V-G (Evidence for Identifying Phishing Sites): “This section examines seven specific types of evidence…”, listing multiple tactics; Table 1 and Section V-B report aggregate Precision/Recall/Accuracy but no per-tactic performance breakdown."}
