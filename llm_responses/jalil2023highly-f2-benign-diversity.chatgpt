{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates its phishing detector solely on existing, pre-classified URL datasets (Kaggle, CatchPhish, Ebbu2017) without any indication that benign samples include low-reputation/long-tail domains or pages embedding legitimate brand elements. Thus it does not exercise the harder benign subsets required for robust false-positive assessment.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 3.1 (“In this paper, we have collected six datasets from three different sources. Two bigger datasets are collected from Kaggle repository whereas, three datasets are collected from the literature … one dataset is collected from … Sahingoz et al. (2019). Distribution of phishing and legitimate URLs …”) – no mention of long-tail domains or legitimate brand-element pages in the benign sets."}
