{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed URL-based deep learning system is only evaluated on clean phishing and legitimate URL datasets with no assessment of its resilience to active evasion techniques (e.g. obfuscated URLs, cloaking, dynamic content, adversarial perturbations) within its scope. There is no experimental evaluation against any form of deliberate attack designed to bypass the detector.","evidence":"Section IV.A, Dataset Collection: phishing URLs from PhishTank and legitimate URLs from Common Crawl are used purely for supervised learning; no mention of tests with obfuscated, hidden, or adversarially manipulated URLs. Section V, Experimental Results: all performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are reported on clean train/validation/test splits without any adversarial or evasive-case evaluation."}
