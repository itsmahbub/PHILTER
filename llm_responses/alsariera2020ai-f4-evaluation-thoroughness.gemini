    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper reports several metrics that are sensitive to class imbalance, including F-measure, False Positive (FP) rate, and False Negative (FN) rate, which is a significant improvement over using accuracy alone. The inclusion of F-measure explicitly considers the balance between precision and recall. However, the evaluation falls short of the 'High' standard because it does not report any of the required summary metrics (AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC). Although 'ROC' is mentioned as a planned evaluation metric in the methodology, no actual ROC curves or AUC values are presented in the results for the proposed models. This constitutes partial but not full metric coverage as defined by the codebook.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III-A: \"The performances of the models’ were evaluated using ROC, Accuracy, False Positive (FP) and F-measure as these metrics are widely used for evaluation of AI-based classification models and it is widely used to evaluate the research works that are closely related to this work as seen in Section II.\"\n\nPage 6, Section III-D: \"The performances of the developed proposed models were evaluated using the following performances as widely used to evaluate existing methods for phishing website detection [3]. These metrics include Accuracy, False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN) and F-measure.\"\n\nPage 8, Tables 1-4: The results for all four proposed models (ABET, RoFBET, BET, LBET) consistently report values for 'Accuracy', 'False Positive', 'False Negative', and 'F-Measure'. None of these tables include values for AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC."
