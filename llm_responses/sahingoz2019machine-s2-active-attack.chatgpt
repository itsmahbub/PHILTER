{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s evaluation is limited to classification accuracy on a clean dataset of real phishing and benign URLs. There is no testing or analysis of evasion techniques—such as injected junk characters, obfuscated text, cloaking, deferred execution, or adversarial perturbations—within its URL‐only scope, nor any adversarial‐robustness experiments.","evidence":"Section 5 (page 10): “We have performed our test on this dataset, which contains 73,575 URLs. This dataset contains 36,400 legitimate URLs and 37,175 phishing URLs.”  No further evaluation of active evasion or adversarial manipulations is reported."}
