    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation is exclusively focused on improving the detection of a small set of 11 phishing websites that were misclassified by a previous study. The methodology and results sections do not mention the use of any benign (non-phishing) dataset for evaluation. Consequently, the paper does not assess the false positive rate of the proposed method. The evaluation lacks any benign pages, let alone a diverse set including low-reputation domains or pages with legitimate brand element usage. This complete omission means the detector's robustness against misclassifying legitimate websites is entirely untested.",
    "evidence": "Page 1495, Section III: 'In our investigation, we analyzed the JSON files from the previous study [6] to examine phishing websites that had not been identified... Of the 59 websites we examined, 17 no longer existed or were invalid (error 404). The browsers also automatically blocked 25 more websites due to security concerns. In addition, the required information could not be scraped for six additional websites. As a result, these 48 websites were not included in our study. In the end, 11 websites were considered for further analysis.' This quote confirms that the entire experimental dataset consists of previously missed phishing websites, with no benign websites included for evaluation."
