{"value":"Medium","why":"While the paper reports class-sensitive metrics (precision and F1-score) and a summary metric (AUC-ROC), it does not explicitly report recall. Under the codebook, a ‘High’ evaluation must include precision, recall, F1-score and at least one summary metric; missing recall means it lacks full metric coverage and thus falls into the ‘Medium’ category.","evidence":"Section 4.4, Table 5: “Table 5 reports accuracy (Acc.), precision (Prec.), f₁-score and AUC for the different visual similarity-based approaches.” No recall values are provided."}
