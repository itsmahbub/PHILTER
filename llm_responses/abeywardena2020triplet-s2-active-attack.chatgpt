{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not include any evaluation of active evasion techniques against its screenshot-based detection method. Although it claims resilience to code obfuscation by virtue of using visual features (Section I), no experiments are conducted against injected junk HTML, adversarial visual perturbations, dynamic content loading, cloaking, or other active attacks observable in the screenshot modality. Evaluation is limited to clean phishing versus benign screenshots without adversarial or evasive manipulations.","evidence":"Section I (page 1): “Since our method does not rely on text and code features, it is resilient to code obfuscation.”; Section V (page 3): Evaluation only reports precision/recall on PhishTank and Alexa screenshots without testing any active attack scenarios."}
