{"value":"Medium","why":"While the method does not provide per-decision explanations (e.g. no SHAP, LIME or decision-path exposés), it does offer global insight into which features drive the model’s performance. In Sect. 6 and Fig. 11 the authors quantify each feature’s standalone predictive accuracy, thereby fulfilling the ‘global or limited insight’ criterion for a Medium interpretability rating.","evidence":"Page 20, Section 6 Discussion: “We also evaluated the contribution of individual features in detection of phishing websites with an aim of identifying top performing features. The statistics of each individual feature is calculated with an accuracy metric using Random Forest algorithm as shown in Fig. 11.”"}
