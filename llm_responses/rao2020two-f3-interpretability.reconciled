{"value":"Medium","why":"BlackPhish provides a per-decision explanation for the first (blacklist) filter – it reports which known phishing fingerprint and target brand triggered the verdict – but its second (heuristic) filter is a non-transparent ensemble (Random Forest, XGBoost, Extra-Tree) with no post-hoc explanations or feature-importance summaries. Thus it offers limited interpretability overall.","evidence":"Page 3 (Contributions): “The BlackPhish provides additional target legitimate site information when the phishing site is detected by the blacklist filter.”\nPage 18, Fig. 6(a): UI popup “Blacklist filter reported … as phishing site targeting …”\nPage 15, Sect. 4.6.1: “We choose XGBoost, Extra-Tree, RF classifiers … to generate the ensemble model …” – no XAI or feature explanations are described thereafter."}
