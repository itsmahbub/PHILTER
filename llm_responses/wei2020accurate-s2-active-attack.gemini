    "why": "The paper proposes a phishing detection method based solely on the URL string. The evaluation is conducted on a dataset composed of phishing URLs from PhishTank and benign URLs from Common Crawl. This experimental setup represents a standard classification task on non-adversarial data. There is no evidence in the paper that the method was tested against active attacks or adversarial manipulations relevant to its modality (the URL string). For example, the authors do not evaluate the model's robustness against URLs specifically crafted to evade a character-level CNN, such as by inserting benign-looking keywords, using complex subdomain structures, or applying adversarial character perturbations. The paper's claim to detect \"zero-day\" attacks refers to its ability to generalize to new, previously unseen URLs from the same data distribution, not its resistance to deliberate evasion attempts designed to fool the detector. The evaluation is limited to clean phishing versus benign examples.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: 'Contrary to the previous works, where URL or traffic statistics or web content are analysed, we analyse only the URL text.'\n\nPage 4, Section 4.1, Phishing dataset: 'Our experiments are based on publicly available PhishTank phishing sites database [30]. The database downloaded during the article writing contained 10,604 records. To obtain legitimate websites, the second part of the training dataset was downloaded from the Common Crawl Foundation (http://commoncrawl.org/).'\n\nPage 6, Section 5, Experiments: 'The dataset described in Section 4.1 was divided into 80% training set and 20% testing set and 5-fold cross-validation was applied. The training error for both networks is shown in Fig. 9. Memory requirements and computation times for both neural networks are shown in Table 4.' This describes a standard evaluation protocol without any mention of active attacks or adversarial examples."
