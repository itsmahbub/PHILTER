    "why": "The paper demonstrates consideration for some active attacks relevant to its logo-based detection method, but its robustness is limited. The authors explicitly state they included altered logo images in their dataset to test for evasion, such as a phisher \"slightly altering the logo image (e.g., scaling down a logo image).\" This shows a direct attempt to evaluate resistance against a relevant adversarial manipulation. However, the analysis section reveals significant weaknesses against other practical evasions. The method's performance degrades when logos are embedded in banners or sprite images, are in vector format (SVG), or are absent entirely. The paper acknowledges these as \"complications\" and sources of error rather than demonstrating resilience. Therefore, the method shows partial robustness against a subset of the relevant attack surface, but not comprehensive resistance.",
    "evidence": "Page 22, Section 3.3: \"To ensure that the proposed method is able to detect all sorts of logo images, we use the logo and non-logo images from both phishing and legitimate websites image resources. This is important, as sometimes the phisher will try to evade the detection by slightly altering the logo image (e.g., scaling down a logo image).\"\n\nPage 24, Section 4: \"Besides the two properties of the logo image mentioned above, there are other factors which have confused our proposed method. They are: • The logo existed within a banner image. • The logo existed within a sprite type of image, which is usually used to optimise webpage loading speed. • The logo image is in a vector graphic file format (e.g., SVG format).\""
