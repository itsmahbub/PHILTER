{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not include any mechanisms to address concept drift—there is no continual or periodic retraining, no time-aware feature engineering, nor any temporal train/test protocol. All evaluations are performed via random splits on static benchmark datasets drawn from different sources, without simulating time-forward deployment or retraining, implying an assumption that phishing tactics remain static.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (Experimental setup, p. 8): “These datasets ... were selected ... Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity ... evaluation metrics.” No mention of temporal splits or time-forward evaluation; Sections 3 and 4 contain no discussion of model adaptation or retraining to evolving phishing trends."}
