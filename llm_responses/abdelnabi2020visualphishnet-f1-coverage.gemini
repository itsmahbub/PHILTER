    "value": "High",
    "why": "The proposed method, VisualPhishNet, is tactic-agnostic by design, as it learns a generalizable visual profile for a website to handle pages with new visual appearances, rather than relying on brittle page-to-page matching. This approach is inherently robust to tactics involving visual modifications. The paper's evaluation section provides an exemplary analysis of tactic diversity. The authors systematically test the model against a wide array of visual evasion tactics, including seven distinct types of hand-crafted image perturbations (blurring, noise, occlusion, shifting, etc.) and white-box adversarial machine learning attacks (FGSM). Crucially, the paper provides a quantitative breakdown of detection performance for each of these evaluated tactics, showing the relative drop in matching accuracy and ROC AUC. Furthermore, it explicitly evaluates the model's performance against unseen \"zero-day\" pages, demonstrating its ability to handle novel attack campaigns. The discussion also provides a qualitative analysis of successful detections, categorizing them by the difficulty of visual mimicry (from exact copies to pages with large design disparities). This comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of specific tactics demonstrates a deep consideration of tactic diversity.",
