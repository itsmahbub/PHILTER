{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed model is trained and evaluated on a static UCI phishing dataset using an 80/20 stratified random split, with no mention of temporal separation, continual learning, or use of features designed to resist drift. Thus it assumes phishing tactics remain static and is not evaluated on data from different time periods.","evidence":"Section 4.2 (page 4): “we split our dataset to 20% for testing and 80% for training by stratified random sampling method.” No temporal evaluation protocol is described."}
