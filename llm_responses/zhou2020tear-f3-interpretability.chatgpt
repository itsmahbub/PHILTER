{"value":"Low","why":"PhishFencing does not include any mechanism—neither inherently interpretable models nor post hoc XAI—to explain individual classification decisions. The method applies a SIFT/FLANN matching step to detect logos and a one-class SVM on host features, but it does not expose feature importances, decision paths, or generate per-decision explanations (e.g., heat-maps or SHAP values). As a result, users and auditors cannot trace which signals led to a phishing or legitimate verdict.","evidence":"Section 3.2 (Phishing Website Identification Algorithm): “we apply host features … to One Class Support Vector Machine …” – no mention of interpretability or explanation techniques is made throughout the paper."}
