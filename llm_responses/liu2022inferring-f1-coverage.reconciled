{"value":"High","why":"PhishIntention explicitly addresses multiple real-world phishing tactics—credential-taking pages vs. CRP-link pages, HTML form obfuscation, and misleading legitimacies—and for each tactic the paper provides (i) the size of the evaluation dataset or test subset, and (ii) quantitative performance metrics. This fulfills the ‘High’ criteria of being tactic-agnostic by design, giving a quantitative breakdown of the dataset by tactic, and reporting per-tactic detection performance.","evidence":"• Table 1 (p.3): Dataset broken down into credential-taking (86.1%), CRP-link (11.2%), non-text-credential (2.4%), other (0.3%) tactics.  \n• Table 3 (p.12, Sec.7.2): Completeness of dynamic CRP-link detection (83.1% on non-CRP phishing, 93.3% on benign).  \n• Table 6 (p.13, Sec.9.2): CRP classification accuracy before/after HTML obfuscation (95.0%→95.0%), vs. HTML-only baseline drop (75.4%→59.2%).  \n• Figure 15 (p.14, Sec.9.2): False positive rates on misleading legitimacies (5.10% for PhishIntention vs. 45.5–60.1% for baselines)."}
