    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper explicitly acknowledges that phishing tactics evolve over time, a key aspect of concept drift, and claims the proposed model is adaptive. It states the model can \"update itself on the latest trends\" and implements \"dynamic, continuously learning mechanisms.\" Additionally, a case study in Section XI tests the model, trained on a static dataset, against a \"real-time dataset of agricultural websites,\" which serves as a limited form of temporal evaluation (testing on newer data than the training set). However, the paper's main quantitative evaluation protocol is standard k-fold cross-validation on a static Kaggle dataset. This method shuffles data, ignoring its temporal nature, and is therefore unsuited for rigorously evaluating resilience to concept drift. The mechanism for how the model \"updates itself\" is also asserted rather than technically described. The combination of acknowledging the problem, claiming an adaptive solution, and conducting a limited temporal case study merits a 'Medium' rating, but the absence of a rigorous temporal evaluation in the main experiments prevents a 'High' rating.",
