{"value":"Low","why":"CANTINA+ is evaluated only on standard phishing and benign corpora, without any systematic testing against the kinds of active evasions (junk HTML, obfuscated scripts, invisible elements, dynamic loading, cloaking, etc.) described in the codebook. While the authors note that they render pages with IE to recover obfuscated DOM and discuss in prose how features might be defeated, there is no empirical evaluation on manipulated or adversarially crafted examples. Hence the paper provides no measured resilience to active attacks in its input modality.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 4 (“We acknowledge that this hashing-based filter is easy to beat…we only use it as a filtering step…”); Page 12, Section 7.2 (describing collection from PhishTank and benign sources only, no adversarially manipulated pages); Page 26, Section 9.3 (noting purely image-based pages defeat text features, but no experiments against such cases)"}
