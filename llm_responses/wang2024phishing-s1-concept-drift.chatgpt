{"value":"High","why":"The proposed method relies on inherently stable visual features (combining full-page and logo-area similarity) and explicitly evaluates resilience to evolving attacks by testing on temporally separated “zero-day” phishing data. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate an adaptive retraining strategy that maintains performance as legitimate page designs change.","evidence":"Section 4.5 (page 10): “There is a temporal separation between these pages and the phishing webpage dataset.”; Section 5 (page 11): “The model needs to be retrained and updated when trusted website pages change… the weighted classification accuracy increases by 14.38% after 5 rounds of retraining.”"}
