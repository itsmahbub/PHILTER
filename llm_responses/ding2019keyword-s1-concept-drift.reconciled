{"value":"Low","why":"The SHLR method uses a fixed rule set and a one‐time trained logistic regression model with no mechanism for continual or periodic retraining, and its evaluation relies solely on random cross‐validation rather than temporally disjoint splits. It does not employ any explicit adaptive strategy (e.g. online learning or stable features designed to resist drift) nor does it simulate time‐forward deployment, so it assumes phishing tactics remain static.","evidence":"Section 4.2.3 (Classifier evaluation): “We perform ten 10-fold cross-validations to assess the effects of different classifiers.”  Section 3.2 (Heuristic rules): the seven URL rules are fixed and derived from a static word list.  No section describes retraining on new data or temporal train/test splits."}
