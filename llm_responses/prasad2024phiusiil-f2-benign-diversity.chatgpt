  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The evaluation of PhiUSIIL’s false positive rate is based solely on legitimate URLs drawn from high‐reputation sources (the Open PageRank top sites).

  "evidence": "Section 3.1 (Dataset Construction): “We collected legitimate URLs from Open PageRank Initiative…”; Section 4.1 (Phase 1): “The target URL is a URL from the list of the top 10 million legitimate websites downloaded from Open PageRank Initiative.”"
