{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method is built around ensemble classifiers (Random Forest and oblique Random Forests) but does not include any mechanism—neither inherently transparent models nor post hoc XAI (e.g. SHAP, LIME, attention maps)—to explain individual classification decisions or expose decision paths. Thus it remains a pure black-box approach.","evidence":"Section 3.2 Machine learning algorithms (p. 3860) – “we used eight machine learning algorithms … Random Forest outperformed the others” with no discussion of interpretability or explanation techniques."}
