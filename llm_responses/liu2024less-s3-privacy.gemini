    "why": "The proposed method, PhishLLM, fundamentally relies on transmitting webpage data to external, third-party cloud services for analysis. The architecture processes a webpage by taking a screenshot, performing OCR on the content, and creating a caption for the logo. This textual representation of the webpage's content and logo is then sent to an external Large Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT-3.5, for inference. Additionally, the method uses Google's Search and Image APIs for domain validation, which involves sending the webpage's domain name to Google's servers. This entire process sends sensitive data derived from the user's browsing activity (webpage content and domain) off-device to external commercial entities. The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving mechanisms like data anonymization, hashing, or local deployment, and in fact acknowledges the system's dependency on these external services as a limitation.",
    "evidence": "page 4, Section 3.1: \"we adopt OCR and image-captioning models to extract the logo's description, generating a logo prompt fed to the LLM to have the domain name d.\"\npage 6, Section 3.1.3 & 3.1.4: \"Logo Validation. Using Google Images service, we retrieve the top-k logos...\" and \"...we further validate the popularity of a website by checking whether its domain has been indexed by Google.\"\npage 9, Section 4.2.2: \"Additionally, network latency associated with accessing OpenAI and Google API services also impacts the overall latency.\"\npage 12, Section 5, Limitations: \"Additionally, our system relies on external services, such as those provided by OpenAI and Google APIs. Consequently, any downtime or delays associated with these services could impact the real-time detection capabilities of our system.\""
