    "why": "The paper satisfies both conditions for a high rating. First, the proposed method is designed to be inherently resilient to concept drift. By focusing on visual similarity (content and structure) between webpages, it avoids volatile, easily altered features like source code or URL patterns. The authors explicitly state that because their method does not rely on text and code features, it is resilient to code obfuscation, a common attacker adaptation. Second, the evaluation protocol explicitly tests for robustness over time. The model is trained on a dataset of legitimate websites collected in January 2019, while one of the primary evaluation datasets ('Target scope') was collected nine months later in October 2019. This temporal split between training and testing data directly assesses the model's ability to handle potential drift and maintain performance on future, unseen data.",
