    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper describes two experiments using two different datasets. For the first experiment, the sources mentioned (PhishTank, MillerSmiles, Google) are primarily for phishing URLs, and the source of benign pages is not specified, making it impossible to assess their diversity. For the second experiment, the paper explicitly states that the benign (legitimate) webpages were sourced from \"Alexa\" and \"Popular Crawl\". These sources consist of popular, high-reputation websites. The methodology does not include any mention of incorporating more challenging benign cases such as low-reputation long-tail domains, newly registered domains, or pages that legitimately use brand elements (e.g., third-party payment or login widgets). This limitation to popular sites for the benign class means the evaluation does not sufficiently test the model against pages that are more likely to be misclassified as phishing, thus fitting the 'Low' criteria.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 4.2, \"Legitimate web pages: Alexa, Popular Crawl, anti-phishing investigators, and experts can consider this database useful for the evaluation of phishing features, fast proof of concept tests, and phishing classification models (Tan, 2018), as shown in table 5.\""
