{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates the proposed URL‐based classifier only on clean and GAN‐augmented phishing vs. benign URL datasets, without testing any active evasion techniques (e.g. obfuscated URLs, adversarial perturbations, junk or invisible characters, dynamic content/cloaking). There is no discussion or experiments targeting bypass attacks relevant to URL‐level obfuscation.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): no mention of active‐attack robustness; Page 5 §5.1 (Datasets and metrics): “we collect … clean phishing URLs … and … train/test only on those” – no tests on evasive or obfuscated URLs."}
