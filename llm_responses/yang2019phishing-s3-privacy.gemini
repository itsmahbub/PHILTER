    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving mechanisms or a specific deployment architecture (e.g., client-side vs. server-side). The proposed method, particularly in its second, more comprehensive stage, requires fetching extensive external data, which inherently leaks information. This stage involves extracting \"webpage code features\" and \"webpage text features,\" which necessitates downloading the full content of the suspicious webpage. Furthermore, it extracts URL statistical features such as \"Alexa ranking\" and WHOIS data (\"Registration time\", \"number of domain name servers\"), which require sending the URL or domain to third-party services. The paper is silent on how this data is handled at inference time, who initiates these external requests, and whether any sanitization or hashing is performed. The lack of any described privacy safeguards for handling full URLs and webpage content classifies this method as low for privacy preservation.",
    "evidence": "page 9, Section C, THE DYNAMIC CATEGORY DECISION ALGORITHM: \"Though the multidimensional feature algorithm has greater accuracy than the CNN-LSTM, the acquisition of WHOIS information and Alexa ranking from the URL, and the extraction of webpage code features and webpage text features take a certain amount of time, which cannot meet the needs of real-time detection.\"\n\npage 8, TABLE 2. URL and webpage code features.: The table lists features like \"Registration time\", \"number of domain name servers\", and \"Alexa ranking\", which can only be obtained by querying external services with the website's domain name.\n\npage 13, Section VI. CONCLUSION: \"In addition, we plan to implement our approach into a plugin for embedding in a Web browser.\" This statement confirms that a client-side, potentially more private deployment is considered future work and not a part of the method described and evaluated in the paper."
