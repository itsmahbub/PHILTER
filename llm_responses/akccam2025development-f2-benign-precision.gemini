    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper evaluates its method using four publicly available datasets but does not provide any analysis or description of the diversity of benign URLs within them. The descriptions of the datasets are purely quantitative, focusing on the number of URLs and the ratio of phishing to legitimate samples. There is no mention of intentionally including challenging benign cases, such as low-reputation or long-tail domains (e.g., personal blogs, small business sites) or legitimate pages that embed third-party brand elements (e.g., social media login widgets, payment buttons). Without evidence of these specific diverse subsets being included in the evaluation, the robustness of the model against common false positive scenarios remains unverified.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2, Datasets: The paper describes the datasets used for evaluation but provides no qualitative information on the benign URLs. The descriptions are limited to counts and class balance:\n- \"The first dataset is the GramBeddings Dataset [8], which contains 799,991 URLs evenly distributed, with 50% phishing and 50% legitimate URLs.\"\n- \"The second dataset, the Malicious and Benign URLs Dataset from Kaggle [22], comprises 450,176 URLs, with an imbalanced distribution of 23.2% phishing and 76.8% legitimate URLs.\"\n- \"The third dataset, the Ebbu2017 Phishing Dataset [2], includes 73,575 URLs, with a nearly balanced distribution of 50.5% phishing and 49.5% legitimate URLs.\"\n- \"The final dataset is the Mendeley Data Web Page Phishing Detection Dataset [23], which contains 11,430 URLs, with 50% phishing and 50% legitimate URLs.\"\nThis lack of detail indicates that the diversity of benign pages was not a criterion for dataset selection or a focus of the evaluation."
