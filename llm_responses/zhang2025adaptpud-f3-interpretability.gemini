    "why": "The paper proposes a complex, multi-component deep learning model (AdaptPUD) consisting of multi-channel CNNs, BiGRU, Self-Attention, and fastKAN. This architecture is inherently a 'black box,' meaning its decision-making process is not transparent. While the model incorporates a Self-Attention (SA) layer, which could potentially be used to generate attention-based explanations (e.g., heatmaps showing which parts of the URL were most influential), the authors do not mention or demonstrate this capability. The paper describes the SA layer's function solely in terms of improving model performance by learning global interactions and creating a context-aware feature representation. The experimental evaluation focuses exclusively on quantitative performance metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score, with no qualitative analysis or mechanism presented to interpret or audit individual classification decisions. The discussion section explains the general rationale for their design (e.g., combining semantic and structural features) but does not provide a way to trace this logic for any specific prediction.",
    "evidence": "page 6, section 4.3.1. P-URLs detection model, \"Subsequently, the SA layer dynamically assigns attention weights to the features, effectively learning global interactions and generating a more robust, context-aware feature representation... This allows the model to dynamically and adaptively distribute attention weights.\" \nThis quote describes the function of the Self-Attention layer purely from a performance perspective. The paper never revisits this mechanism to offer it as a source of interpretability for its predictions. The entire experimental section (Section 5) and discussion (Section 6) lack any form of per-decision explanation or visualization, confirming the model's black-box nature."
