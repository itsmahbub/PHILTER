{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper evaluates performance using only true positive rate (recall) and false positive rate, but does not report precision, F1-score or any summary metric (AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, or MCC). Thus it provides some class-sensitive measures but lacks full coverage of the required metrics.","evidence":"Section 5 (page 8): “Two metrics are used to evaluate the performance, which are true positive (TP) rate and false positive (FP) rate.”"}
