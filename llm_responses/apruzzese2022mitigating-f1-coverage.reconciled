{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper employs a diverse set of URL‐, reputation‐, and HTML‐based features (e.g. Fake HTTPS, ‘Dots number’, Shortener detection, Domain Age) that inherently cover multiple phishing tactics and applies a tactic‐agnostic feature‐mapping defense (POC). However, it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation datasets by tactic nor report detection performance per tactic, as required for a “High” rating.","evidence":"Page 4 Table 2: Lists features such as Fake HTTPS (HTTPS misuse), Dots number (subdomain spoofing), Shortener (URL redirection), Domain Age (newly registered domains).\nPage 5 § 4.2: Describes attacks on variable subsets of these features, indicating the method’s tactic‐agnostic design.\nNowhere in the paper are samples categorized by phishing tactic, nor is there per‐tactic performance reporting (no section or table breaks down results by tactic)."}
