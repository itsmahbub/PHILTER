{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed method avoids volatile, third-party–dependent signals by using only lexical URL features (e.g., special characters, entropy, TF-IDF brand matching), but its evaluation protocol uses a random 70/30 train/test split rather than a time-forward split and does not explicitly address concept drift or retraining over time.","evidence":"Page 9236, Advantages of the proposed framework: “Not utilizing 3rd party based features … features are extracted directly from the URL” ; Page 9237, Section 3.3 Train/Test ratio: “we have used 70% data for training the models and 30% data for testing the models.”"}
