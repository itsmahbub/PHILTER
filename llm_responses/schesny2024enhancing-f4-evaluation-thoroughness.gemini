    "why": "The paper evaluates its method's performance using raw counts and a simple \"hit rate\" on a small, curated dataset of 11 known phishing websites. It does not report any of the required class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) or summary metrics (AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, MCC). The evaluation is limited to counting how many of the 11 phishing sites were correctly identified, which is insufficient to understand the model's behavior, particularly concerning false positives (misclassifying legitimate sites). This omission of standard metrics prevents a meaningful assessment of the method's performance under real-world conditions where class imbalance is a major factor.",
    "evidence": "page: 2, section: III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION, supporting quote: \"The hit rates for detected threats are the same for Scenario 2 and 3, with five out of eleven websites detected. In Scenario 1, four websites were successfully identified, and one was marked with the status “unknown”.\""
