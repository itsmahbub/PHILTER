{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s evaluation relies entirely on static datasets and k-fold cross-validation without training on earlier data and testing on newer samples, and although it claims ‘dynamic, continuously learning mechanisms’ and a real-time case study, no concrete adaptive strategy (e.g., continual learning or periodic retraining) or rigorous temporal split is implemented. Therefore, it neither avoids volatile features by design nor evaluates resilience to concept drift over time.","evidence":"Page 47556, Section VI.A (Materials & Methods): “Within this research, we have chosen the dataset labelled ‘Phishing Website URLs’ sourced from Kaggle….” (no temporal splitting) and Page 47564, Section X.B.1 (Performance of Individual Model): “Through a process known as cross-validation… the data is divided into k-folds with k=10….” (no time-forward evaluation)"}
