{"value":"Medium","why":"The MFPD method employs a variety of URL‐based and content‐based features (e.g. IP‐address URLs, HTTPS misuse, edit‐distance to target domains, lexical patterns, HTML/JS anomalies), demonstrating that it addresses multiple phishing tactics in its design. However, the paper evaluates overall accuracy on a large, unlabeled phishing dataset without providing a quantitative breakdown of tactics in the evaluation set or reporting performance per tactic.","evidence":"Table 2 (Page 8, Section IV.B) lists URL statistical features addressing multiple tactics (e.g. “IP address”, “HTTPS protocol”, “Edit distance outlier”), yet in Section V (Pages 10–11) the authors report only aggregate accuracy and FPR/FNR on millions of URLs and do not provide any per‐tactic dataset composition or per‐tactic performance metrics."}
