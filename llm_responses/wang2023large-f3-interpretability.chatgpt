{"value":"Low","why":"PhishBERT is presented as a high-performance but opaque Transformer model with no built-in or post hoc explanation mechanism. The paper does not describe any feature importance analysis, attention visualization, SHAP/LIME attributions, nor an inherently interpretable structure; it focuses solely on pre-training, fine-tuning, and performance metrics.","evidence":"Across the entire paper (Sections 2–4), there is no mention of interpretability or explanation techniques (e.g., XAI methods, attention heatmaps, feature importances)."}
