{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s benign dataset is drawn entirely from dmoztools.net without any demonstrated effort to include the specific subsets required by the codebook (low-reputation/long-tail domains or legitimate pages embedding brand elements). There is no evidence the authors sampled newly registered, personal, small/regional business sites, nor that they included benign pages with PayPal/OAuth widgets or social-media logos. Thus, it fails to cover either of the two harder benign subsets and deserves a “Low” rating.","evidence":"Page 2, Section I – “we build a real dataset by crawling … 989 021 legitimate URLs … from dmoztools.net.” No further mention of low-reputation/long-tail domains or pages with legitimate brand elements."}
