{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method uses static, offline machine learning classifiers evaluated via random train–test splits and 10-fold cross-validation, with no temporal separation of training and testing data or adaptive retraining to address evolving phishing tactics. There is no mechanism for continual learning or time-aware feature design, and evaluations do not simulate time-forward deployment.","evidence":"Page 10, Section 4.1: “The two classes training and testing based on the 10-fold cross-validation… validation by random method… The result was built based on 70% training and testing.”\nPage 15, Section 4.2: Dataset 2 samples “were accessed between January 2015 and June 2017,” but results are reported via random splits rather than time-separated train/test."}
