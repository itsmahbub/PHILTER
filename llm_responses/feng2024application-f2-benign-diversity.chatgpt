{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates its detector solely on the standard UCI phishing website dataset without any mention of including harder benign subsets such as long-tail/low-reputation domains or pages with legitimate brand elements. Thus it relies on broadly sampled (and likely popular) benign sites and does not address the required diversity.","evidence":"Page 9, Sec. 4.2: “We adopt dataset named Phishing website dataset come from the UCI repository. This dataset collect mainly from PhishTank archive, MillerSmiles archive and Google’s searching operators. The dataset is consisted of 11,055 samples which have 30 features pre-classified as phishing and benign.” No further subdivision or inclusion of low-reputation or brand-element benign pages is described."}
