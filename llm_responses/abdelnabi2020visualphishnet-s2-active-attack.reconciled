{"value":"Medium","why":"VisualPhishNet evaluates robustness only against a subset of relevant screenshot-level evasions (hand-crafted pixel perturbations and FGSM adversarial noise) but does not assess other active attacks observable in its input modality—such as injection of invisible elements, visual cloaking, or junk HTML—so it demonstrates only partial robustness within its scope.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 6.7: “Performance against hand-crafted perturbations. We studied 7 types of perturbations… Adversarial perturbations. …we propose and investigate an adaptation of the adversarial example generation methods…”"}
