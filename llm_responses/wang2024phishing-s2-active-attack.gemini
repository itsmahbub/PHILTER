    "why": "The paper evaluates the proposed method against a subset of active attacks relevant to its visual modality. It explicitly tests for robustness against adversarial image perturbations, namely salt and pepper noise and the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). The authors demonstrate that while the model is initially vulnerable to FGSM, it can be made robust through adversarial fine-tuning. The method's design is also inherently resilient to source-code level manipulations (e.g., replacing HTML text with embedded objects) because it analyzes the rendered webpage screenshot. However, the evaluation does not address other significant active attacks such as runtime evasions (e.g., dynamic content loading, deferred execution after user interaction) or cloaking, which are relevant even for a screenshot-based system. Therefore, it demonstrates partial but not comprehensive resistance to active attacks.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section 4.4, \"In this part, two adversarial attacks are applied to the proposed model to analyze the model's efficacy in defending against adversarial attacks. The salt and pepper noise and the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) (Shlens et al., 2015) are selected to evaluate the model's robustness.\"\nPage 10, Section 4.4, \"The experiment result shows that the matching accuracy decreases by 9.54% and 19.3% when ε = 0.002 and ε = 0.008, respectively. Then, the model was fine-tuned by using adversarial samples with ε = 0.008. After retraining... the matching accuracy decreases by 0.70% and 4.45%... Therefore, the model is robust to adversarial samples generated by FGSM after fine-tuning.\""
