    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method is a deep learning model consisting of ResNet and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) branches to generate high-dimensional embeddings for content and structural similarity. The final classification is based on a distance metric in this embedding space. This type of model is inherently a \"black box,\" as it does not provide insight into its decision-making process. The paper does not mention or implement any inherent interpretability features or post hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP) to explain which specific visual or structural features in a webpage screenshot led to its classification. Although an FPN is used for structural analysis, its output is flattened into a high-dimensional vector for distance computation, rather than being used to visualize or explain the structural components contributing to the decision.",
    "evidence": "Page 2, Section IV-A: \"Figure 2 shows our CNN architecture, which has two main paths. The upper path contains a triplet network based on the ResNet that focuses on measuring content similarity. The bottom path contains a triplet network based on FPN that focuses on structural similarity.\"\nPage 3, Section IV-A: \"The output is flattened to obtain the structural embedding S ∈ R^50,176. We calculate the positive and negative segmentation distances...\"\nPage 3, Section IV-D: \"During the evaluation... We obtain the C ∈ R^128 and S ∈ R^50,176 for each image... we retrieve k nearest neighbours and decide whether there is a match based on an empirically obtained threshold.\" The entire methodology describes a process that results in a similarity score without any mechanism for explaining the components of that score."
