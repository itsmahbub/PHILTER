    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method relies on sending extensive data from the evaluated website to an external, third-party Large Language Model (ChatGPT) for analysis. The methodology explicitly details the extraction of the website's URL, HTML content, and text from a screenshot (via OCR). This information is then used to construct a prompt and sent to the external service. This process involves transmitting the full, unfiltered URL and page content off the user's device to a third party, which is a significant privacy risk. The paper does not mention any privacy-preserving mechanisms such as data sanitization, hashing, or local inference.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Section II, Figure 1: The flowchart visually depicts the entire process. It starts with an \"Input URL\", proceeds to extract \"HTML Code\" and performs \"OCR\" on a \"Screenshot\". All this information is then consolidated into a \"Prompt ChatGPT\" step, clearly indicating that sensitive webpage data is sent to an external service for processing.\n\nPage 1, Section II, METHODOLOGY: The text describes the workflow, confirming the data sent to the LLM: \"...we have developed an expanded methodology with the following steps: (1) input of websites, detected as nonphishing by the underlying approach [6]; (2) enrichment of the websites' metadata with the input URLs; (3) extraction of the website's content and metadata; (4) construction of the CoT yielding prompts for the LLM; (5) use of the LLM's output to classify website...\""
