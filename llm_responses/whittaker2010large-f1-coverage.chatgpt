{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper’s phishing classifier explicitly incorporates features targeting multiple real-world phishing tactics—URL-based (IP hosts, long/subdomain spoofing, lexical tokens), hosting-based (autonomous systems, geolocation), and content-based (password fields, TF-IDF terms, external links)—but it does not report detection performance broken down by individual tactic categories.","evidence":"Section 3.2.2 (URL Features – IP Address for Hostname, Long Hostname, URL Tokens), Section 3.2.4 (Hosting and Page Features – ASN/geolocation, password field, TF-IDF, external linking); Section 4.2 evaluates feature correlations overall without per-tactic performance metrics."}
