{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed URL-based method incorporates features designed to detect multiple phishing tactics observable in URLs (e.g., HTTPS misuse, IP-based URLs, subdomain spoofing, lexical manipulations), satisfying the criterion of addressing multiple tactics. However, the evaluation reports only aggregate performance metrics without any per-tactic breakdown, matching the “Medium” level.","evidence":"Page 7, Table 2: Features such as ‘NoHttps’, ‘IpAddress’, ‘SubdomainLevel’, ‘NumDots’, ‘NumDashInHostname’, and ‘UrlLengthRT’ capture diverse URL-based phishing tactics.\nPage 11, Section IV.D (“DATA DIVERSITY”): “Our feature set includes structural aspects (… double slashes, hostname length, URL components…) as well as semantic markers (…) to ensure the model is sensitive to the intricacies present in complex phishing efforts.”\nPage 15, Table 4: All reported performance metrics (ROC, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, Accuracy) are aggregated over the entire test dataset, with no per-tactic performance breakdown."}
