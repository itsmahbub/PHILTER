{"value":"Low","why":"The authors evaluate false positives only on benign websites drawn from popular Alexa Top-5,000 to Top-15,000 domains, without including low-reputation (long-tail) domains or benign pages that embed legitimate brand elements. Thus, neither of the “harder” benign subsets is represented in the detection benchmark, underestimating potential false positives.","evidence":"Section 4.1.3 Datasets (page 528): “We collected a comparable number of benign websites (6,075) by crawling from the Alexa Top 5,000 to 15,000 websites.”"}
