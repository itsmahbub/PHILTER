    "why": "The paper demonstrates robustness against a subset of active attacks but lacks a comprehensive experimental evaluation against a diverse set of evasions. The method's primary defense is its use of a browser engine (Internet Explorer) to render pages and execute JavaScript, which inherently counters some dynamic content loading and obfuscation techniques. Furthermore, the authors dedicate a detailed discussion section (Section 9.1) to theoretically analyzing how each of their 15 features could be individually attacked or evaded by a motivated phisher (e.g., using images instead of text, manipulating keywords, altering link structures). \n\nHowever, the experimental evaluation, while extensive, does not explicitly test the system against a corpus of pages known to employ these specific evasive techniques. The evaluation focuses on performance on real-world data from PhishTank but does not stratify the results based on the presence of adversarial manipulations. The paper acknowledges limitations, such as pages made purely of images. Therefore, while the design considers and partially addresses some active attacks, its resilience is not empirically demonstrated across the full attack surface discussed.",
    "evidence": "page 12, section 7.2, \"employed Internet Explorer to render the Web pages and execute Javascript, so that the DOM of the downloaded copy truly corresponds to the page content and thus gets around phishing obfuscations.\"\n\npage 21, section 9.1, \"(7) Bad forms. ... To spoof this feature, attackers could use login keywords beyond our dictionary, put the login keyword outside the FORM tag in the HTML, or rely on images of text, etc. In responding to phishers' manipulation, we can design new constraints or relax existing ones in this feature to capture more phishing patterns...\"\n\npage 26, section 9.3, \"Attackers sometimes build phishing web pages purely made up of images, leaving our algorithm no text to analyze. Although text-based technique is infeasible here, the sheer fact that there are only a bunch of images and a login form without text at all on a web page is a good indicator of a phishing attack, and we could train models using this as a feature.\""
