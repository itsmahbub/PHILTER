{"value":"Low","why":"The authors’ benign dataset consists solely of 22,687 pages drawn from the top-ranked Alexa list, with no inclusion of long-tail or recently registered domains nor of benign pages containing embedded brand elements (e.g., OAuth widgets or social media logos). This limited set of high‐reputation sites fails to exercise the harder benign subsets required for a robust false‐positive evaluation.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 4.2 “Benign web page dataset. We collated 22,687 benign web pages from the top‐ranked Alexa list for this experiment.”"}
