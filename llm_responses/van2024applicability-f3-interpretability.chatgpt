{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed hybrid framework relies solely on stacked deep learning and ensemble models without implementing any per‐decision explainability or feature‐attribution techniques. The individual models and the stacking functions are treated as black boxes; no XAI methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention maps) or decision‐path visualizations are provided to explain why a specific webpage is classified as phishing or legitimate.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 3 ‘Limitations’: “Although Deep Learning shows advantages for the automated detection of phishing websites, it has limitations. First, these models operate in a black‐box fashion, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind the prediction… when the output results are largely uninterpretable (Do et al. 2022).”"}
