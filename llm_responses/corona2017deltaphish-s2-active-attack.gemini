    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper designs its system with adversarial resilience in mind and conducts a dedicated evaluation against a specific type of active attack. The authors simulate a worst-case, white-box adversarial evasion attack where the adversary has perfect knowledge of the HTML-based classifier and manipulates HTML features to evade detection. The results demonstrate that their proposed fusion mechanisms, which combine HTML and visual analysis, can maintain a detection rate above 70% even when the HTML classifier is completely fooled. The system's browser automation also inherently handles obfuscated JavaScript. However, this evaluation is limited to a subset of possible active attacks. The authors explicitly state they do not evaluate attacks targeting the visual (snapshot-based) classifier, which is their other main modality. Therefore, while the paper shows strong evidence of robustness against feature-level adversarial manipulation, it does not demonstrate resilience against a diverse set of active attacks across its full input space, fitting the criteria for a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "p.15, Section 4.2, \"Adversarial Evasion. We consider here an attacker that manipulates the HTML code of his/her phishing page to resemble that of the homepage of the compromised website, aiming to evade detection by our HTML-based classifier. We simulate a worst-case scenario in which the attacker has perfect knowledge of such a classifier, i.e., that he/she knows the weights assigned by the classifier to each HTML feature. The idea of this evasion attack is to maximally decrease the classification score of the HTML module while manipulating the minimum number of features...\"\n\np.16, Section 5, \"the detection rate of maximum and adversarial fusion rules under attack remains higher than 70%. The underlying reason is that they rely more upon the output of the Snapshot-based classifier with respect to the trained fusion.\"\n\np.12, Section 4, \"Notably, we have not considered attacks against the Snapshot-based classifier as they would require modifying the visual aspect of the phishing page, thus making it easier for the victim to recognize the phishing scam.\"\n\np.6, Section 3.1, \"The browser automation module launches a browser instance using Selenium to gather the snapshot of the landing web page and its HTML source, even if the latter is dynamically generated with (obfuscated) JavaScript code.\""
