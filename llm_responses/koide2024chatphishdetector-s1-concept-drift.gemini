    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method is designed to be inherently resilient to concept drift by leveraging the general, pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of training on specific, time-bound features that can become obsolete, the system identifies high-level, stable concepts like brand impersonation, social engineering techniques, and semantic inconsistencies. This approach avoids the need for continuous retraining on new phishing examples. However, the paper's evaluation methodology does not explicitly validate this resilience over time. The dataset was collected over a narrow two-month window, and there is no temporal split between training and testing data to simulate real-world drift. Additionally, the authors acknowledge a limitation related to the LLM's knowledge cutoff date, which could affect detection of new brands. Because the method is designed to be robust to drift but is not evaluated in a manner that proves it, it earns a 'Medium' rating.",
