    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper proposes an adaptive strategy for its model, which is a key method for addressing concept drift. The authors explicitly state their intention to use an incremental learning strategy for updating the XGBoost and LightGBM components of their stacking model, and a retraining approach for the GBDT component, when new phishing data becomes available. This shows a clear consideration for the evolving nature of phishing attacks. However, the evaluation protocol does not validate this capability. The primary datasets (50K-PD and 50K-IPD) are collected over a very long time span (e.g., June 2009 to June 2017), which is ideal for studying concept drift. Yet, the paper describes a standard random 70/30 train-test split, rather than a chronological split (training on older data and testing on newer data). This means the model's claimed ability to adapt to new, unseen tactics over time is not empirically demonstrated. The method includes an adaptive mechanism, but the evaluation is not designed to prove its effectiveness against concept drift, thus fitting the 'Medium' criteria.",
    "evidence": "p. 10, Section 4.11, 'In terms of updating the model, we use incremental learning strategy to train XGB and LGB if there are new phishing data, which avoids training from scratch. For the basic model GBDT, we may add the new phishing data into training set to train an updated model.'\n\np. 5, Section 4.1, 'On the other hand, the phishing webpages are collected from Phishtank, which have been validated from June 2009 to June 2017.'\n\np. 8, Section 4.5, 'The evaluations are conducted on the 50K-PD dataset, which is divided into a training set consisting of 70% data samples, and a test set containing the rest ones.'"
