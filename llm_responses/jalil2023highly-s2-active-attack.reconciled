{"value":"Medium","why":"While the paper does not perform adversarial testing or provide a quantitative breakdown of specific evasion tactics, its URL‐only feature set explicitly targets several common manipulation and obfuscation techniques (e.g. URL shorteners, junk delimiters, embedded ‘@’, suspicious keywords, brand-name spoofing, entropy of randomized segments). This constitutes inherent defenses appropriate to its input modality and meets the codebook’s “Medium” criteria.","evidence":"Page 9, Table 3 “List of proposed 30 features” – includes features such as F1 At_url (detects ‘@’ tricks), F3 Delims_url/Other_delims_url (junk characters), F11 Tiny_url (URL shorteners), F8 Suspwords_url (suspicious keywords), H4 Brand_host/P11 Brand_path (brand-name matching), and entropy measures (F10, P13) against randomized segments."}
