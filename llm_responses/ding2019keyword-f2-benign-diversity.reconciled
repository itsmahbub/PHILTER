{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s benign evaluation uses only Yahoo and DMOZ directories—collections of largely established, popular domains—and does not include dedicated samples of low-reputation/long-tail sites or benign pages embedding brand elements (e.g., PayPal/OAuth widgets or logos). Therefore it fails to satisfy either of the two required diversity criteria.","evidence":"Page 12, Section 4: “We use … Yahoo datasets (5883 unique domain URLs) … and DMOZ (9509 unique domain URLs) … PhishTank and URLBlacklist are phishing URL sets, and Yahoo and DMOZ are legal URL sets.” No other benign subsets are described."}
