{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed STFL method does not include any temporal evaluation of concept drift (e.g., training on older data and testing on newer data), nor does it employ inherently stable features to guard against evolving phishing tactics. All evaluations use random splits of static datasets and there is no simulation of time-forward deployment or periodic retraining on newly observed user data over time.","evidence":"Page 6, Section V.B Experimental Setting: “We divided the Khramtsova et al. dataset into a training and testing set (90%:10%).” (random split, no temporal ordering)"}
