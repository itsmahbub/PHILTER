    "why": "The proposed method, BlackPhish, explicitly addresses multiple phishing tactics through its two-level architecture. The first level (blacklist filter) uses fuzzy hashing on content (Simhash) and screenshots (Perceptual hash) to detect replicas, near-duplicates, and phishing sites that replace text with images. The second level (heuristic filter) uses a comprehensive set of URL and source-code features to detect other tactics, including the use of IP addresses in URLs, subdomain spoofing (\"Presence of brandname in subdomain\"), and various lexical manipulations (e.g., number of dots, hyphens). \n\nHowever, the paper does not meet the criteria for a \"High\" rating. While the methodology is designed to be robust against tactic diversity, the evaluation section lacks a quantitative breakdown of the dataset by the types of phishing tactics present. The paper reports overall performance metrics (Accuracy, MCC, etc.) but does not analyze or report the detection performance for each specific tactic it is designed to counter. Therefore, it successfully addresses multiple tactics but does not provide the per-tactic evaluation breakdown required for the highest rating.",
