{"value":"Medium","why":"The PhiUSIIL framework uses an adaptive strategy—incremental learning—to continuously update its model with new data, but its evaluation does not employ temporally disjoint train/test splits to measure resilience to future phishing patterns. Instead, the paper reports random or percentage‐based splits (e.g. 10:90, 20:80) rather than training on earlier data and testing on later data.","evidence":"(1) “the incremental learning approach allows the framework to continuously update its knowledge base with new data.” – page 1, Abstract; (2) Section 5.6/Table 7 (page 14) shows performance on random pre-training : incremental training splits (e.g. 10:90, 20:80) with no mention of temporal evaluation."}
