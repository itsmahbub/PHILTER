{"value":"Low","why":"The paper focuses exclusively on classification performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1‐score, specificity) and runtime of various ML algorithms, without providing any per‐decision explanations, feature‐level insights (e.g. SHAP/LIME), or exposing decision paths of inherently interpretable models. There is no mechanism described for explaining or auditing individual predictions.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 3.6 (Performance evaluation): “performance evaluation measurements including accuracy, recall, precision, F1_score, and specificity”; nowhere in the methodology or experiments are explainability or feature‐importance analyses reported."}
