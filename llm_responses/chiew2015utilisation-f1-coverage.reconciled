{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed logo-based detection is tactic-agnostic by design—it relies on identity verification through logo–domain consistency rather than any specific URL pattern or hosting environment—so it inherently covers multiple tactics (e.g. URL obfuscation, subdomain spoofing, compromised hosting). However, the authors do not provide a quantitative breakdown of phishing samples by tactic nor report performance on a per-tactic basis, placing it in the “Medium” category.","evidence":"Page 22, Section 3.3: “Phishing webpages are downloaded from PhishTank and legitimate webpages are from Alexa within different categories… Dataset 3… consists of 500 other unpopular legitimate webpages… to evaluate… very challenging situations.”\n\nNo section of the evaluation breaks down results by specific phishing tactics or reports per-tactic performance."}
