{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method trains and evaluates on a static dataset using random splits, without any temporal or drift-aware evaluation or adaptive retraining strategy. It assumes phishing features remain static over time and does not address concept drift.","evidence":"Section 4.2 (Dataset used): “We divided the dataset into two sets: training set and test set. 75% of original dataset is taken as training set… and remaining 25% of the dataset is taken as test set, which is used to evaluate the model.” No temporal split or time-forward evaluation is described."}
