{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method relies solely on nine generic lexical URL features and evaluates on the ISCXURL-2016 dataset without any mention or categorization of specific phishing tactics (e.g. homograph attacks, subdomain spoofing, HTTPS misuse). There is no per-tactic breakdown of the dataset or reporting of performance by tactic, indicating that tactic diversity is ignored.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “we have developed a phishing detection approach that only needs nine lexical features …”; Section 3.3 (Features extraction): lists only generic lexical features; Section 4.3 (Dataset): uses ISCXURL-2016 without any tactic labels or per-tactic evaluation."}
