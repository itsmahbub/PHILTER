{"value":"Low","why":"DeltaPhish does not include any adaptive or continual‐learning strategies to address evolving phishing tactics, nor does it perform any time‐aware evaluation (e.g. training on older data and testing on newer data). Instead, the authors randomly split their dataset of phishing and legitimate pages by website (‘family’) without regard to collection date, effectively assuming that phishing characteristics remain static.","evidence":"Page 13, Section 4.1: “In each repetition, we randomly select 60% of the families for training, while the remaining 40% are used for testing.”"}
