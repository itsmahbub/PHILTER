    "why": "The proposed method (SHLR) is a static, three-stage pipeline that does not incorporate any mechanisms to adapt to concept drift. The heuristic rules are fixed, derived from a one-time statistical analysis of the PhishTank dataset. The machine learning model, a Logistic Regression classifier, is trained on a static feature set without any provision for online learning or periodic retraining to account for evolving phishing tactics. \n\nThe evaluation methodology also fails to address concept drift. The experiments rely on standard cross-validation and splits of static datasets (PhishTank, Yahoo, URLBlacklist, DMOZ) without any temporal separation. The paper does not mention the collection dates of the URLs and does not follow the standard protocol of training on older data and testing on newer data. Consequently, both the method's design and its evaluation assume that the characteristics of phishing attacks are static.",
    "evidence": "Page 14, Section 4.2.3: \"For this part of the URL, the machine learning classifier is used for the third detection. We perform ten 10-fold cross-validations to assess the effects of different classifiers.\" This describes a standard static training and evaluation process (cross-validation) on a fixed dataset, not a temporal evaluation designed to measure adaptation to drift.\n\nPage 6, Section 2: \"We statistically analyze 2776 phishing URLs obtained in PhishTank and design a rule base for phishing URLs using confusing techniques based on the results of the statistical analysis...\" This shows that the heuristic rules, a core component of the system, are static and derived from a fixed dataset, making them vulnerable to new obfuscation techniques not present in the original data.\n\nPage 12, Section 4: \"We use a total of four datasets: the PhishTank blacklist (2776 unique domain URLs) maintained by Internet users, Yahoo datasets (5883 unique domain URLs), URLBlacklist (2216 unique domain URLs) collected by SquidGuard, and DMOZ (9509 unique domain URLs)...\" The description of the datasets lacks any temporal information, and the subsequent experimental design does not utilize a time-based split, which is essential for evaluating robustness against concept drift."
