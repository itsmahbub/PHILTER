{"value":"Medium","why":"The benign evaluation set clearly includes low-reputation/long-tail domains (Tranco ranks 100 000–105 000) but does not explicitly incorporate pages known to embed legitimate brand elements (e.g., PayPal buttons or social-media widgets). Merely instructing the LLM to handle such cases in its prompt does not constitute sampling or testing on a dedicated benign subset with real brand-element usage. Therefore only one of the two required subsets is present, yielding a Medium rating.","evidence":"Section IV.A (page 4): “For benign pages, we visited the top-ranked websites from the Tranco list. Specifically, we crawled the top 10 000 ranked domains and those that ranked between 100 000 and 105 000…”  \nSection III.B (page 4): “Note that some pages may include information/logos of other brands, especially pages that use single sign-on features or pages created by website builders.” (prompt instruction only)"}
