{"value":"Medium","why":"AdaptPUD is designed to be tactic-agnostic by combining semantic and structural URL features—enabling it to handle diverse phishing strategies such as domain spoofing, typosquatting, cloud-hosted links and dynamic URL patterns. However, the experimental evaluation reports only overall detection rates (and a small general vs. tailored deceptive phishing split) without a detailed, quantitative breakdown of performance per phishing tactic.","evidence":"Section 4.2 (structural-semantic URL representation): “In the TPE method … tokens capture semantic features, while properties capture structural features.”; Section 5.4 (practical application): “we collected 30 active P-URLs … categorizing them into two groups: general P-URLs and tailored deceptive P-URLs … AdaptPUD performs exceptionally well across both categories.” – no per-tactic performance breakdown provided."}
