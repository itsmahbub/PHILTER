    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper exclusively details the architecture and offline performance of a stacked ensemble machine learning model (MLSELM) using pre-existing, static datasets. There is a complete absence of information regarding its deployment or how it would handle user data at inference time in a real-world setting. The methodology describes a pipeline where a 'Phishing Dataset' is fed into the model for training and evaluation. No mention is made of client-side processing, deployment within a secure boundary (like a network gateway), or the implementation of any privacy-preserving techniques such as URL hashing or feature anonymization. According to the metric's criteria, when no inference-time data-handling details are provided, the lowest rating is assigned, as it cannot be guaranteed that sensitive data like full URLs or webpage content would not be sent to an external server for analysis.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III. PROPOSED MODEL & Section III-A. DATASET: The model architecture (Figure 2) and the dataset description confirm that the work is based on offline evaluation. The text states, 'The proposed work applied on four datasets named as D1, D2, D3, D4. D1 is collected from UCI repository [17]...'. The entire methodology is framed around processing these static datasets, with no discussion of a real-time detection mechanism or its interaction with a user's browser or device. The paper does not contain any section discussing deployment, privacy implications, or data flow during a live detection event."
