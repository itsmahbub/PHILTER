{"value":"High","why":"The paper’s evaluation reports class-sensitive metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score) alongside a summary metric (AUC of the ROC curve), thereby providing a comprehensive assessment that accounts for class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 5.1.3: “We select seven metrics widely used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of DL-based models: Accuracy, Recall, False Positive Rate (FPR), Precision, F1-score, ROC curves, and AUC.”; Page 9, Fig. 6: ROC curves with reported AUC values."}
