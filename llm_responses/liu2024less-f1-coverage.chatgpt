{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishLLM is designed to be tactic-agnostic—leveraging LLM-decoded brand knowledge, credential-taking semantics, and visual-language analysis to cover a wide range of phishing strategies—but the evaluation does not include a quantitative, per-tactic breakdown of performance (e.g., homograph vs. subdomain spoofing vs. hosting tactics).","evidence":"Section 4.2 (Overall Performance, Table 3) reports only aggregate precision and recall; no results are broken down by specific phishing tactics (e.g., HTTPS misuse, compromised domains, homograph attacks)."}
