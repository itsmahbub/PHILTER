    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a deep learning model that operates on a static dataset with pre-defined, extracted features related to URL and HTML structure. The evaluation is limited to a standard classification task on this dataset, comparing phishing vs. benign samples. There is no evidence that the model was tested against any active attacks or evasive techniques. The methodology does not include dynamic analysis, code de-obfuscation, or any mechanism to handle deliberate manipulations intended to bypass feature-based detection. The benchmark is confined to clean, non-adversarial examples, failing to assess the model's resilience to real-world evasion tactics.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III-A, DATASET DESCRIPTION: \"In this study, our focus revolves around a meticulously curated dataset comprising 10,000 instances, each characterized by various attributes associated with URLs and web pages. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle [40], is specifically designed for the identification of phishing websites...\"\n\nPage 7, TABLE 2. Summary of features in the phishing detection dataset: The paper relies on a fixed set of static features such as `NumDots`, `HostnameLength`, `DoubleSlashInPath`, `IframeOrFrame`, etc. These features are extracted from the URL and page source but do not account for dynamic content or obfuscated code.\n\nPage 12, Section V, SIMULATION RESULTS: The entire evaluation section focuses on standard classification metrics (confusion matrices, ROC curves, accuracy) derived from performance on the static Kaggle dataset. There is no mention of testing against adversarial examples, obfuscation, cloaking, or other evasive maneuvers."
