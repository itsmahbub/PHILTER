{"value":"Low","why":"The POC approach neither uses inherently time-stable features nor incorporates any adaptive mechanism (e.g., continual learning or periodic retraining) and is only evaluated on static random splits. There is no temporal (train-on-older, test-on-newer) evaluation to demonstrate resilience to concept drift.","evidence":"Section 6.1 (Testbed): “We apply an 80:20 split for the training and test partitions…” – indicates a static random split without temporal separation.\nSection 5.2 (Analysis of POC): “ML detectors must be updated with new data to prevent concept-drift [40], [78]. To further facilitate such ‘updates’, we will release our source code…” – only proposes future periodic updates but does not implement or evaluate them."}
