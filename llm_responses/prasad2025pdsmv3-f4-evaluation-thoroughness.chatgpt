{"value":"High","why":"The authors evaluate their phishing detection method with class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall/TPR, F1-score, and false positive rate) and also report an overall summary metric (AUC). This combination satisfies the requirement for a robust, imbalance-aware evaluation.","evidence":"Section 4.3 (Table 3): ‘Precision’, ‘TPR’, ‘F1-Score’, ‘FPR’ reported. Section 4.3.2 (Table 6): ‘Accuracy’, ‘AUC’, ‘F1-Score’ reported."}
