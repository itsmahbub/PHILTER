{"value":"Low","why":"The paper trains and tests models using a random 80/20 split on a static dataset collected by Vrbančič et al. (2020) and does not employ any adaptive strategy (e.g. continual learning, time-aware features) nor evaluate on temporally separated data to assess resilience to evolving phishing tactics. Thus it assumes phishing tactics remain static and is not evaluated across different time periods.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.1: “80% of the dataset is used to train our model, and 20% of the dataset is used for testing to evaluate its performance.”; no mention of temporal evaluation or adaptive retraining throughout the paper."}
