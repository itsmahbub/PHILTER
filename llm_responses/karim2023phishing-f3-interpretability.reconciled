{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper applies a Decision Tree model—an inherently interpretable algorithm—alongside other black-box methods, but does not provide any per-decision traceability or post hoc explanation (e.g., SHAP, LIME, feature importances, or visualized decision paths). According to the codebook, using an inherently transparent model without exposing its decision logic meets the “Medium” interpretability criterion.","evidence":"Page 8, Section III (Material and Methods): lists “decision tree (DT)” among the applied models. Page 10, Section IV.A (Experimental Results of the Decision Tree): evaluates DT performance purely by accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and F1-score, with no presentation of decision paths or interpretability analyses."}
