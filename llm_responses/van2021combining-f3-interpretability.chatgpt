{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method operates as a black-box similarity classifier—it uses search engine results, visual/textual feature extraction, and standard similarity metrics with a logistic-regression threshold to decide legitimacy, but provides no per-decision explanations, no feature importances or decision paths, nor any post-hoc XAI outputs to justify individual classifications.","evidence":"Page 5, Sec. 3.1: “The similarity scores are then used to generate feedback (7) about the legitimacy of the current web page.”  Page 7, Sec. 4.4: “These approaches compare two images and give a score between 0.0 and 1.0… Logistic regression using 10-fold cross validation was used to compute the threshold for the classification.”"}
