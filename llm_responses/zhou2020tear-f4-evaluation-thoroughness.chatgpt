{"value": "Medium", "why": "The evaluation reports class-sensitive metrics—precision, recall, and F1-score (e.g., Section 5.2 defines P, R, and F1; Section 5.3 reports 97.8% precision and 97.7% recall, and matching F1 in Figure 4)—but does not include any summary metric such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC, which are required for a ‘High’ rating under the codebook.", "evidence": "Page 12, Section 5.2: “The overall performance is measured in terms of precision (Poverall) and recall (Roverall)... We also employed the F1-score to combine both precision and recall...” Page 14, Section 5.3: “PhishFencing reaches 97.8% precision and 97.7% recall...” (no AUC or MCC reported)"}
