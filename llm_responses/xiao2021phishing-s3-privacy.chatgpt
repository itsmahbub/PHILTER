{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method requires sending users’ full, unfiltered URLs (up to 99 characters including all parameters) into an externally trained CNN + self‐attention classifier, and the paper gives no details on client‐side deployment or any privacy‐preserving mechanisms (e.g. hashing, truncation, federated learning, or anonymized feature vectors).","evidence":"Page 6, Section 4.2 “Building classifier with CNN and multi‐head self‐attention”: “URLs are transformed into initial matrixes with one‐hot encoding” – no mention of sanitizing, hashing, or local inference."}
