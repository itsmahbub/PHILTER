    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper demonstrates robustness against a diverse set of active attacks relevant to its vision-based and dynamic analysis modalities. The authors explicitly define a threat model that includes HTML obfuscation and adversarial attacks on deep learning models. They conduct dedicated experiments (RQ4) to validate their system's resilience. The results show that PhishIntention is largely unaffected by HTML obfuscation, unlike purely HTML-based methods. It also incorporates a gradient-masking defense against multiple common adversarial attacks, showing high effectiveness for its classifier models. Furthermore, the system's core dynamic analysis, which involves emulating clicks to find credential-requiring pages (CRPs), is inherently designed to counter deferred execution attacks where the phishing form is not on the initial landing page. Finally, the authors show awareness of cloaking by implementing countermeasures (multiple VPNs) in their real-world field study. This comprehensive evaluation against multiple, relevant attack vectors justifies a 'High' rating.",
