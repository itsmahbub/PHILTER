{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed meta-learner models are trained and evaluated via standard 10-fold cross-validation on a single static dataset (the UCI phishing website benchmark) and make no use of adaptive strategies (e.g. continual learning, periodic retraining, or temporally aware features), nor do they employ a time-based train/test split to reflect concept drift over time.","evidence":"Page 4, Section III.A (“the development of the AI-based meta-learner models was conducted using the N-fold cross-validation technique [19]. In this research work, N was set to 10.”) and throughout the paper: only a single static dataset is used with no temporal splitting or adaptive retraining protocol described."}
