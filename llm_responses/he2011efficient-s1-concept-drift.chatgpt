{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method relies on a one-time offline SVM trained on a static set of phishing and legitimate pages and evaluated on held-out pages; it does not include any adaptive retraining or concept‐drift handling, nor does it use temporally separated training and testing data to assess robustness over time.","evidence":"Section 5.1 (Evaluation): “we took 50 legitimate and 50 phishing pages as the training set … The testing dataset is composed by the rest of 150 legitimate and 275 phishing pages.” No mention of temporal or time‐forward split."}
