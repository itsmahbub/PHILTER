    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper reports several key evaluation metrics suitable for class imbalance, including precision, recall, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Both experiments provide tables (Table 4 and Table 6) and figures (Figure 7 and Figure 10) detailing these results. This covers most of the required metrics. However, the evaluation does not include the F1-score, which is a required class-sensitive metric for the 'High' rating. The absence of F1-score means the evaluation lacks full metric coverage.",
    "evidence": "Page 13, Table 4, \"Experimental results 1: Comparison results between 16 Machine learning algorithms as a classifier\": The table columns include \"MLA Precision\", \"MLA Recall\", and \"MLA AUC\".\nPage 16, Table 6, \"Experimental results 2: Comparison results between 16 Machine learning algorithms as a classifier.\": This table also includes columns for \"MLA Precision\", \"MLA Recall\", and \"MLA AUC\".\nPage 14, Figure 7 & Page 17, Figure 10: These figures explicitly show the \"ROC Curve comparison\" for both experiments and list the AUC values for each classifier, confirming the use of a summary metric."
