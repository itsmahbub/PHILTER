{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class‐sensitive metrics (precision and recall) for phishing detection (Table 2) and presents ROC curves (Figure 10), but it does not report F1‐scores or any numeric area‐under‐curve (AUC‐ROC or AUC‐PR) or MCC summary metrics. Thus, while some relevant metrics are provided, the evaluation lacks full coverage of the required class‐imbalance measures.","evidence":"Table 2 (page 3799): “Precision … Recall …”; Figure 10 (page 3799): “ROC curves (with FPR in log scale) for the four phishing identification solutions.”"}
