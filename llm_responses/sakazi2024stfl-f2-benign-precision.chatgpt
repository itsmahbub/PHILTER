{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s evaluation uses benign URLs drawn from Common Crawl and Alexa top-ranked domains (via PDRCNN) and a generic benign set from Khramtsova et al., but it does not include any curated low-reputation or long-tail domains nor pages with legitimate embedded brand elements. Therefore, it lacks both harder benign subsets required for a more robust false positive assessment.","evidence":"Page 5, Section V.A (“Datasets”): “CPURNN dataset … 1,200,000 benign URLs from Common Crawl.”; “PDRCNN dataset … benign URLs … collected … domain names that appear in the Alexa 1M URLs.”"}
