    "why": "The evaluation's benign dataset demonstrates strong diversity by meeting both required criteria. First, it explicitly includes low-reputation or long-tail domains by sampling not only from the Tranco top 10,000 but also from ranks 100,000-105,000. This was done intentionally to capture websites with varying levels of popularity. Second, the methodology accounts for benign pages that legitimately use brand elements. The prompt engineered for the LLM explicitly instructs it to be aware of pages that include logos of other brands, specifically mentioning \"single sign-on features or pages created by website builders.\" This indicates that the evaluation was designed to handle and was likely tested against these harder benign cases, which are naturally found when sampling from a broad range of websites.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section IV. DATA COLLECTION: \"For benign pages, we visited the top-ranked websites from the Tranco list [35]. Specifically, we crawled the top 10,000 ranked domains and those that ranked between 100,000 and 105,000, so as to include a broad spectrum of legitimate webpages that vary in popularity.\"\n\nPage 4, Section III-B: \"Note that some pages may include information / logos of other brands, especially pages that use single sign-on features or pages created by website builders.\""
