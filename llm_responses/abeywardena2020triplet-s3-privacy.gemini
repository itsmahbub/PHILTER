    "why": "The proposed method relies on capturing a screenshot of a potentially malicious webpage and comparing its visual features against a pre-existing database of legitimate target page screenshots. The paper describes the scenario as follows: \"given a screenshot of a web page, we want to decide whether it is a possible phishing attempt to a well known website for which we have stored the screenshots.\" This process implies that the screenshot, which contains sensitive information about the user's browsing activity and the full page content, must be processed. The paper does not specify a deployment architecture, such as on-device inference or a privacy-preserving protocol for comparison. The most straightforward implementation would involve sending the user's screenshot to a central server where the model and the database of target screenshots are hosted. This constitutes a significant privacy risk. Since no inference-time data-handling details or privacy safeguards are described, the method is evaluated as Low.",
    "evidence": "page 1, section I. INTRODUCTION, supporting quote: \"The specific phishing detection scenario we consider is that, given a screenshot of a web page, we want to decide whether it is a possible phishing attempt to a well known website for which we have stored the screenshots. Many organizations indeed know what pages are usually being targeted (e.g., Office 365) and there are lists of common targets [14]. Thus, it is possible to maintain a database of target web pages and their screenshots and new web pages can be matched against them.\""
