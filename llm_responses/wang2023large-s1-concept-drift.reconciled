{"value":"Low","why":"PhishBERT does not include any adaptive mechanisms (e.g., continual learning, periodic retraining, or time-aware feature engineering) nor does it explicitly select inherently stable features with respect to evolving phishing tactics. Furthermore, its evaluation protocol uses static train–test splits drawn from the same time window, without any temporal separation to simulate concept drift. Thus, it assumes phishing tactics remain static and provides no empirical validation against time-forward data.","evidence":"Page 3, Section 3.2 (‘We extract phishing URL data … scraped 2.19 million pieces of data from PhishTank before April 2022 … sampled 200,000 verified phishing URLs.’); Page 4, Section 4 (‘Experiment Scenario … reducing the training set size and training epoch …’) – no mention of temporally separated evaluation or adaptive retraining."}
