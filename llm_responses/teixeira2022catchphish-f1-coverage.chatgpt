{"value":"Low","why":"CatchPhish is designed exclusively to detect homographic (typosquatting) attacks via lexical manipulations and does not address any other real-world phishing tactics (e.g. HTTPS misuse, redirections, shared hosting, subdomain spoofing). The evaluation is performed only on a synthetic dataset of typosquatting variations without any breakdown of multiple tactics.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “CatchPhish uses a Siamese neural network capable of identifying the presence of typosquatting mentions in phishing pages.”; Page 4 (Section III.A): “The first step of CatchPhish is building the database ... obtains as output a labeled dataset containing typosquatting terms of the selected brands ... ten characteristics ... giving rise to a labeled database, composed of 33,077 distorted terms.”"}
