{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method focuses exclusively on identifying cloned webpages via visual and textual similarity without considering or evaluating the broad range of evasion tactics (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, URL redirection, use of IP‐based URLs, lexical manipulations). The evaluation dataset is described only by target brands (Table 2) and contains no breakdown or analysis of different phishing tactics, nor is per‐tactic performance reported.","evidence":"Section 4.2.1 (page 7), Table 2: “Target composition of the phishing dataset.” No information is given on tactics beyond brand targets; no per‐tactic breakdown or performance is provided anywhere in the paper."}
