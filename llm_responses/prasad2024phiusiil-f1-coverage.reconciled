{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper explicitly specifies that it targets a broad range of phishing tactics—‘zero‐width characters, homograph, punycode, homophone, bit squatting, and combosquatting’ via its URL Similarity Index and also engineers features for tactics like IP‐based URLs, subdomain spoofing, and URL redirection. However, while multiple tactics are clearly addressed, the evaluation does not include a quantitative breakdown of how many URLs of each tactic appear in the dataset nor per‐tactic detection performance. This matches the “Medium” criterion.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “The similarity index helps effectively identify visual similarity‐based attacks such as zero‐width characters, homograph, punycode, homophone, bit squatting, and combosquatting attacks.”\nPage 5 (Section 3.1.2): Features ‘IsDomainIP’ and ‘NoOfSubDomain’ target IP‐based URLs and subdomain spoofing.\nPage 6 (Section 3.1.3): Feature ‘NoOfURLRedirect’ targets URL redirection tactics.\nNo section reports per‐tactic counts or per‐tactic performance breakdown."}
