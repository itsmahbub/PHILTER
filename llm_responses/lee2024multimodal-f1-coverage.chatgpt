{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed LLM-based system focuses solely on brand identification and domain verification without considering the full spectrum of real-world phishing tactics (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, URL redirections, use of IP URLs, compromised domains, lexical manipulations, etc.). The evaluation dataset is labeled only by brand targets and lacks any per-tactic annotation or performance breakdown, and the paper does not discuss handling or measuring detection across diverse phishing tactics.","evidence":"Section IV (Data Collection): the dataset is described as 1,499 phishing pages labeled only with target brands. No mention of tactic categories or per-tactic performance. Sections V–VII focus exclusively on brand identification and adversarial logo perturbations, with no reference to other phishing tactics."}
