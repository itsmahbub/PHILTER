    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation of benign pages relies almost exclusively on high-reputation and popular websites. The authors explicitly state their legitimate dataset \"mainly focuses on popular sites, commonly spammed sites, common phishing target sites, etc.\" The sources for the benign corpus, as detailed in Table I, include the \"Top 100 English sites from Alexa.com,\" \"Generic banks on Yahoo directory,\" and \"The most common phishing targets,\" all of which represent well-established, high-reputation domains. The dataset does not include subsets specifically designed to test robustness against low-reputation/long-tail domains or pages with legitimate third-party brand element usage (e.g., PayPal widgets, social media logins), which are common sources of false positives. This methodology aligns with the 'Low' criteria, as the evaluation is limited to popular sites and does not address the specified diversity subsets needed for a more robust false positive assessment.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 7.2, Web Page Corpus: \"Our legitimate collection mainly focuses on popular sites, commonly spammed sites, common phishing target sites, etc. Although our corpus is not representative of what users would experience in their everyday browsing, by evaluating CANTINA+ on these hard cases, we actually provide pessimistic performance statistics in terms of FP, which is more beneficial for an objective evaluation of our method and its real-life application that follows.\"\n\nPage 12, Table I, Legitimate Collections from 5 Sources: The table lists the sources for the legitimate dataset, which include \"Top 100 English sites from Alexa.com\", \"Generic banks on Yahoo directory\", and \"The most common phishing targets [Sheng et al. 2009]\"."
