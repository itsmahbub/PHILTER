{"value":"Medium","why":"Phishpedia includes explicit defenses—step‐ReLU gradient masking—against adversarial manipulations of its visual input (screenshots) and evaluates them on multiple state‐of‐the‐art adversarial attacks (DAG, DeepFool, i-FGSM, i-StepLL, JSMA, and even BPDA). This fulfills the \"Medium\" level, which requires defending against manipulation within its input modality and evaluation on adversarial datasets. However, it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of diverse, naturally occurring evasions in real phishing examples (e.g., junk HTML, invisible elements) as required for \"High\" robustness.","evidence":"Page 7, §3.3: “we also incorporate a gradient masking technique…by replacing ReLU with a step‐ReLU to counter adversarial attacks.”\nPage 12, §5.6.1 & Table 6: shows that after adversarial attacks (i-FGSM, i-StepLL, JSMA, DeepFool), the transformed Siamese model’s accuracy remains 93.5%, whereas the original model’s accuracy drops to near 0%."}
