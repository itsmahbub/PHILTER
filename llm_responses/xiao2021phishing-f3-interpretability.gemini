    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a deep learning model combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a multi-head self-attention mechanism. While the self-attention component inherently calculates weights that could be used to explain which parts of a URL the model focuses on, the authors do not leverage this capability for interpretability. The paper mentions that the attention output \"demonstrates the different importance of each part of URLs,\" but it does not present any visualizations (like heatmaps) or analyses to explain individual predictions. No post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are applied, and the model's internal decision-making process is not exposed. Therefore, the system operates as a pure black box, providing classification outputs without any accompanying justification.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.2, \"This output is called A-output, which demonstrates the different importance of each part of URLs.\" - This quote acknowledges that the model's architecture has a component capable of providing insight into feature importance. However, the paper never utilizes this 'A-output' or the underlying attention weights to provide any form of explanation for its predictions in the methodology or experimental results sections. The entire evaluation (Section 5) is based on quantitative performance metrics (Accuracy, FPR, Rec, Pre, F1, Detection time) without any qualitative analysis of the model's reasoning."
