{"value":"Low","why":"The CatchPhish method assumes static phishing behavior and evaluates performance on a single pooled dataset without any temporal separation between training and testing. It does not employ continual learning, periodic retraining, or time-aware evaluation protocols to assess resilience to evolving phishing tactics (concept drift).","evidence":"Page 4, Section III.A: “At the end of the construction, the data are divided into training and validation sets, respecting the proportion of 60% for training, 20% for test and 20% for validation.”; Page 7, Section V: “For this experiment, 57,356 occurrences were collected … in the year 2020.”"}
