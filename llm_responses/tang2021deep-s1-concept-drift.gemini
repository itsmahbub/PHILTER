    "why": "The proposed framework is explicitly designed with an adaptive strategy to address concept drift. It features a \"closed-loop\" data system that collects user feedback on new or missed phishing URLs. This feedback is verified and used to update the training dataset, enabling periodic retraining of the models to adapt to evolving threats. This is a clear mechanism for handling concept drift. However, the paper's experimental evaluation does not validate this capability. The evaluation is performed on static datasets using a standard random train-test split, rather than a temporally-aware protocol (e.g., training on older data and testing on newer data). Therefore, while the system design anticipates concept drift, its resilience is not empirically demonstrated under realistic temporal conditions.",
    "evidence": "p. 12, Section VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK: \"We utilized closed-loop data to drive better performance of machine learning models. A dataset is fundamental to model training, and high-quality data can improve the performance of a model. The feedback data from users are high-quality data with advancement, accuracy, and sensitivity.\"\np. 7, Section D. CLOUD APPLICATION: \"When a false alarm or missed alarm occurs in the prediction service, the user can take the initiative to report the current falsely detected URL from the browser plug-in portal... Once the review is completed, these URLs will be regularly synchronized to the data collection module...\"\np. 8, Section V. EVALUATION RESULTS: \"In addition, the test data ratio is 0.2.\" (This indicates a standard random split rather than a temporal one, and the rest of the section provides no evidence of time-based evaluation.)"
