    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper explicitly acknowledges and discusses several URL-based phishing tactics, including typosquatting, bitsquatting, homograph attacks, and punycode representation. The proposed method, a character-level Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is intentionally designed to be tactic-agnostic by learning patterns directly from the URL string without relying on pre-defined, hand-crafted features that might be specific to any single tactic. This design choice implicitly addresses the diversity of lexical and structural manipulations found in phishing URLs. However, the paper does not meet the criteria for a 'High' rating because it lacks a quantitative analysis of the tactic distribution within its evaluation dataset (from PhishTank) and does not report the model's performance on a per-tactic basis. The evaluation is conducted on the dataset as a whole, providing only aggregate performance metrics.",
    "evidence": "Acknowledging multiple tactics: 'In this work, we are mainly interested in the following attack methods. The most commonly used method is the registration of domains with a slightly changed structure (typosquatting) [5]... There is a similar bitsquatting technique [6]... Another method is a homograph attack [7]... Another method is the punycode representation [8].' (Page 1-2, Section 1 & 2).\n\nMethod designed to be general: 'Contrary to the previous works, where URL or traffic statistics or web content are analysed, we analyse only the URL text... In the paper, we use one-hot character-level encoding to input URLs to the neural network. The rationale behind this choice is that URLs are composed of words in various languages or strings not constituting words.' (Page 1-2, Abstract & Section 1).\n\nLack of per-tactic breakdown in evaluation: The experiments in Section 5 and the results in Tables 5 and 7 compare the proposed model against others using aggregate metrics like Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for the entire test set. There is no breakdown of these results for different categories of phishing attacks."
