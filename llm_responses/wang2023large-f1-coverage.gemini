    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method, PhishBERT, is designed to be tactic-agnostic, which allows it to implicitly handle a variety of URL-based phishing tactics. By pre-training on a massive and diverse corpus of over 3 billion URLs and using a custom BPE tokenizer on raw unicode character sequences, the model learns generalizable representations of URL structure and syntax. This design avoids reliance on specific, hand-crafted features and can inherently capture various lexical and structural manipulations used by attackers, such as subdomain spoofing, typosquatting, and potentially homograph attacks. However, the paper's evaluation section does not explicitly validate this capability. The evaluation dataset (PhishTank) is not broken down by phishing tactic, and the performance is not reported on a per-tactic basis. Therefore, while the method's design addresses multiple tactics, it lacks a quantitative analysis to confirm its effectiveness against them individually.",
    "evidence": "Page 2, Section 2.2, Input Representation: \"We create a purely automated tokenization scheme by learning the underlying syntactic structure of URL data... We treat the URL as a sequence of unicode characters, which saves us from having to do any pre-tokenization.\" \nPage 3, Section 3.1, Pre-training Data: \"For pre-training of PhishBERT, we craft a large-scale URL corpus covering over 3 billion URLs by collecting various data sources. We denote this corpus as D... D1 contains 2.85 billion web page URLs, extracted from Common Crawl... D3 is a dataset containing 538.2 million URLs, most of which are expired domains related to pornography, gambling, scams, phishing and etc. D4 is a collection of 2.2 million URLs extracted from PhishTank\"\nPage 3, Section 4, Metrics: \"We use the following three metrics, accuracy, F1-score, TPR@FPR=0.01%.\" The evaluation focuses on aggregate performance metrics without any breakdown by attack vector."
