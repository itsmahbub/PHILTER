{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper’s phishing classifier uses logistic regression, an inherently transparent model whose parameters (feature weights) define the decision boundary. However, the authors do not describe any mechanism to expose per‐decision explanations (e.g. by showing the path or contributions of individual features for each decision) nor do they apply post hoc XAI techniques (e.g. LIME/SHAP). Thus it provides limited, global interpretability through its choice of model but no per‐instance traceability.","evidence":"Section 3.2.5 (‘Page Classification’): “To compute this score… the classifier combines these values using a logistic regression defined by the classification model [5].” No further discussion of per‐decision explanations or feature‐importance reporting appears in the paper."}
