    "why": "The paper does not describe a client-side deployment or any privacy-preserving mechanisms for inference. The proposed model, AdaptPUD, is a complex deep learning model, and its architecture for handling concept drift and incremental learning implies a centralized server-side deployment. Specifically, the system collects URLs that the model fails to detect to create new datasets for retraining, a process that necessitates sending user data to a central server. Crucially, the authors explicitly state that deploying the model on client-side devices is a direction for future work requiring model compression and optimization, confirming the current design is not meant for local execution. As there is no mention of URL hashing, anonymization, or other safeguards, the default assumption is that full, raw URLs are transmitted to an external server for classification, which presents a significant privacy risk.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 6, Discussion: \"The second direction is to deploy the model to resource-constrained mobile or edge devices. This will require compressing and optimizing the model to ensure its efficient operation in environments with limited computational and storage resources. These improvements aim to deliver a tailored deceptive phishing website detection solution that is both efficient and accurate, with the potential for practical deployment in real-world scenarios.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 5.3.2, Evaluation of CDD method and incremental training: \"We collected the P-URLs that AdaptPUD failed to detect as positive samples for the subsequent CDD dataset... According to the CDD method, 9,800 drift data are labeled and used for incremental training of AdapPUD.\""
