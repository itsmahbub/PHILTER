{"value": "Low", "why": "The paper does not include any evaluation of the proposed URL-based CNN detector against active evasive or adversarial manipulations (e.g., junk characters, deliberate homograph or bitsquatting variants beyond those naturally occurring in the PhishTank data, or adversarially crafted URLs). Experiments are limited to clean phishing vs. benign URLs drawn from standard datasets, with no testing of robustness to intentional evasions within the URL modality.", "evidence": "Section 5 (Experiments): “The CNN method proposed in the paper was compared with other approaches … on the dataset described in Section 4.1. The dataset described in Section 4.1 was divided into 80% training set and 20% testing set …”  (no mention of adversarial or evasive URL variants)"}
