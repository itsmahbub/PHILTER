{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed URL-based CNN method is tactic-agnostic by design and explicitly considers multiple URL manipulation tactics (typosquatting, bitsquatting, homograph attacks, punycode, etc.), but the evaluation reports only aggregate detection metrics on a balanced phishing/legitimate dataset without any quantitative per-tactic breakdown of performance.","evidence":"Page 1, Introduction: “In this work, we are mainly interested in the following attack methods. The most commonly used method is the registration of domains with a slightly changed structure (typosquatting)… There is a similar bitsquatting technique… Another method is a homograph attack… Another method is the punycode representation.”; Page 7, Section 5, Table 5 and accompanying text: only overall AUC, accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score are reported, with no per-tactic performance breakdown."}
