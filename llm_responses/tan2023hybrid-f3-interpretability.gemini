    "why": "The proposed method is a multi-stage pipeline composed of inherently interpretable components, not a black-box model. The core of the visual identity detection is a Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) module that ranks potential logo images based on a weighted sum of eight handcrafted, human-understandable features like position, colorfulness, and padding space. The textual identity component similarly relies on a weighted system based on URL tokens. The final decision is a direct comparison between the suspect domain and domains returned by search engine queries. While the model's logic is transparent and could be manually traced by an expert (as the authors do in their error analysis in Section 4.6), the paper does not describe a system for automatically generating or exposing the specific decision path or feature contributions for each individual classification. This aligns with the definition of using an inherently interpretable model without providing per-decision traceability.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section 3.1.4, \"To perform the ranking, we utilised compromise programming which is one of the MCDM methods. Compromise programming provides a way to systematically combine values of different features into a single distance metric value Lp, as shown in Eq. (14). ... In determining the weight of the features, we regard certain features to be more important in distinguishing the website logo and hence, should be awarded higher weights. By empirical testing, the optimal weights of the feature were assigned as specified in Table 2.\"\n\nPage 11, Section 3.3.4, \"In short, the 3-tier identity matching module exploits domain name matching, ccTLD matching, and IP address matching to achieve a more logical ownership identification... The final output of the 3-tier identity matching module is a binary decision of either phishing or legitimate.\"\n\nPage 13, Table 7, the authors perform a manual analysis of misclassified samples, demonstrating the model's transparency by identifying specific reasons for failure (e.g., \"Logo exists in square form, causing it to be perceived as more likely to be a non-logo (feature F6)\"). This shows the model is interpretable but that the interpretation is a manual analysis, not an automated output."
