{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper explicitly designs and evaluates defenses against common content-level evasions—minor text manipulations (misspellings, tag changes, path alterations) and replacing text with images—within its HTML- and screenshot-based input scope using fuzzy hashing (Simhash) and perceptual hashing. These evaluations on replicas collected at later time periods demonstrate partial robustness to active attacks involving near-duplicate manipulations. However, the work does not address more advanced evasions such as obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, deferred execution or cloaking, so it does not cover the full attack surface.","evidence":[{"page":7,"section":"3.1.1 Feature extraction","quote":"F5—Feature based on screenshot … This feature counters the phishing sites which replaces the textual content with an image as shown in Fig. 5."},{"page":8,"section":"3.1.2 Blacklist database generation—replica detection","quote":"The main intention to choose the dataset at different time slots is to illustrate that phishing sites gets repeated with replica or manipulated content over time."},{"page":8,"section":"3.1.1 Feature extraction","quote":"F4—Feature based on plaintext … We employed fuzzy similarity measure on the plain text of the website for the detection process."}]}
