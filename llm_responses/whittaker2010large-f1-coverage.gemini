    "why": "The paper's proposed method addresses multiple, distinct phishing tactics through a diverse feature set spanning URL structure, hosting information, and page content. The features are designed to detect common tactics such as using IP addresses in hostnames, subdomain spoofing via long hostnames, lexical manipulation of URLs, and impersonation of trusted brands through page content. Features like Autonomous System Number (ASN) and geolocation analysis provide a degree of tactic-agnosticism by focusing on suspicious hosting infrastructure rather than specific attack patterns. However, the paper does not meet the criteria for 'High' because its evaluation lacks a quantitative breakdown of the dataset by tactic, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. While it analyzes the prevalence of certain features (e.g., IP address hosts, long hostnames), it does not evaluate the classifier's performance against these specific tactics individually.",

Another feature this process extracts is whether the page has many host components. Phishers commonly use a long hostname... Besides manipulating the structure of their URLs, phishers often include characteristic strings in their URLs to mislead viewers."

Instead, the feature extractor only makes features of the terms with the highest term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values."
