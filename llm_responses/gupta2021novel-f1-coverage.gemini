    "why": "The paper proposes a URL-based phishing detection method using nine lexical features. The selection of these features demonstrates an awareness of multiple phishing tactics observable in URLs. Specifically, features such as 'No. of top-level domain', 'No. of dots in URL', and 'No. of token in a domain' are designed to capture subdomain spoofing tactics. Other features, including 'No. of delimiter in a domain', 'Length of an URL', and 'Length of longest token in the path', target common lexical manipulation and obfuscation strategies used by attackers. This indicates that the method addresses multiple phishing tactics. However, the paper does not meet the criteria for a 'High' rating because the evaluation section lacks a quantitative breakdown of the phishing tactics present in the evaluation dataset (ISCXURL-2016). Consequently, it does not report detection performance on a per-tactic basis, instead treating all phishing instances as a single, undifferentiated class.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.3: The paper defines features that implicitly target different tactics. For example:\n- Feature 2, 'No. of top-level domain': \"It is observed that attackers use multiple top-level domains within a domain name.\"\n- Feature 5, 'No. of dots in URL': \"Generally, legitimate websites do not have many dots in a URL. On the other hand, phishing websites have comparatively more numbers of dots. Dots are usually used to misguide the legitimacy of the website.\"\n- Feature 6, 'No. of delimiter in a domain': \"The presence of a delimiter, for example, a dashed or a + symbol in URL www.face-book.com... can make a phishing URL look like a legitimate one.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 4.3: The paper describes the dataset used but does not provide a breakdown of the tactics within it. \"To evaluate our proposed approach, we have used a dataset 'ISCXURL-2016' from the data repository of the University of Canada Brunswick. It contains spam records, phishing links, malware, defacements, and benign URLs. We have extracted 10000 benign and 9964 phishing URLs from the repository.\" This description confirms the absence of any analysis on the diversity of phishing tactics within the dataset."
