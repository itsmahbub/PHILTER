    "why": "The paper proposes a static machine learning model that is trained offline and then deployed. There is no mechanism described for adapting to concept drift, such as online learning or automated periodic retraining. The features used are primarily lexical (e.g., character counts in URL components) and network-based (e.g., domain age), which are known to be susceptible to evolving attacker tactics. Crucially, the evaluation methodology does not account for temporal dynamics. The paper explicitly states that the dataset is split randomly for both the initial training/testing and the 10-fold cross-validation. This approach mixes older and newer data, failing to simulate a real-world scenario where a model trained on past data must detect future, potentially different, phishing attacks. While the authors mention that the cloud deployment facilitates future updates, this is a manual process and not an inherent adaptive capability of the proposed method.",
