{"value":"High","why":"Phishpedia is architected to avoid volatile, drift‐prone signals by relying on inherently stable visual identity features (logos), and is evaluated in a true time–forward deployment: its pre‐trained models (never seeing any phishing samples) are run daily on emerging domains over a 30-day span to catch new, unseen phishing sites. This prospective evaluation on data drawn from later time periods directly addresses concept drift.","evidence":"Page 2–3 (Abstract/Introduction): “different from common approaches, Phishpedia does not require training on any phishing samples, thus avoiding potential biases in phishing samples” – avoids volatile features by design. Page 13 (Section 6.2 ‘Phishing discovery experiment’): “We apply Phishpedia to scan and identify phishing webpages from the reported emerging domains every day…We ran all the solutions for 30 days (from Sep, 10 to Oct 9, 2020).” – a live, time‐forward evaluation on future data."}
