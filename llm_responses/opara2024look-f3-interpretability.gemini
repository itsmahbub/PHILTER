    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method, WebPhish, is a deep neural network based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This type of model is inherently a 'black box', meaning its internal decision-making process is not directly understandable. The paper does not incorporate any mechanisms to enhance interpretability, such as attention layers, nor does it apply any post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM) to explain individual predictions. The evaluation focuses entirely on quantitative performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score, and the discussion section rationalizes the overall model design rather than providing a way to audit or understand why a specific URL was flagged. The limitations section also does not acknowledge the lack of interpretability.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3, The proposed model: \"In this section, we elaborate on the architecture of our proposed deep neural network model, WebPhish... WebPhish vectorizes the URLs and the words in the HTML source code using the Tokeniser utility class... The tokenized characters and words are fed into the embedding layer as an array.\"\n\nPage 5, Figure 1 & Section 3.4: The model architecture is shown to be a standard sequence of embedding, convolutional, max pooling, and fully connected layers, which are not inherently interpretable.\n\nPage 7, Section 4.4, Evaluation metrics: \"We evaluated the performance of WebPhish using Precision, Recall and F1-score... We also use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the precision-recall curve for our evaluation.\" This section lists only quantitative performance metrics and makes no mention of any interpretability analysis.\n\nPage 12, Section 6.4, Limitations of WebPhish: The authors discuss limitations related to evasion attacks (e.g., using JavaScript or images) but do not mention the model's lack of transparency or its black-box nature as a limitation."
