    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper details a deep learning model that processes raw URL strings through character- and word-based feature extraction. However, it provides no information on the deployment architecture or how inference would be performed in a real-world setting. There is no mention of client-side processing, on-device inference, or any privacy-preserving techniques like URL hashing, federated learning, or feature anonymization. The methodology implies that the full URL is required for the feature extraction process. The authors explicitly state that real-time evaluation was not conducted. According to the codebook, when no inference-time data handling or privacy safeguards are described, a 'Low' rating is assigned, as the default assumption is that full, unfiltered data (the URL) would be sent to an external server for classification.",
    "evidence": "Page 28, Section 6.1, Strengths, limitations and future work of the model: 'In addition, the model's effectiveness in real-time environments was not evaluated, as this was outside the scope of the study.'\nPage 28, Section 6.1, Strengths, limitations and future work of the model: 'Real-time detection is another critical area for future research. Evaluating the performance and response time of the model in real-time environments is essential to understanding how it handles previously unseen URLs.'\nGeneral observation: The paper's methodology (Sections 4.2, 4.3) describes a standard model development process focused on offline training and testing. It lacks any discussion of deployment models (e.g., API, browser extension, gateway) or the privacy implications of making predictions on user-submitted URLs."
