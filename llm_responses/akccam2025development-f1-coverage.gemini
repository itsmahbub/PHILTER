    "why": "The paper's method, which combines character-level and word-level analysis of URLs, is designed to be sensitive to a variety of phishing tactics observable in the URL string, such as lexical manipulations and structural anomalies. The authors explicitly demonstrate an awareness of tactic diversity by dedicating a specific section (5.3) to the evaluation of shortened URLs, a common evasion tactic. They compile a dedicated dataset of shortened URLs, provide a quantitative breakdown of its composition, and report detailed performance metrics for it. This goes beyond a generic evaluation and shows a conscious effort to test the model's robustness against a specific attack vector. However, the evaluation does not achieve a 'High' rating because this detailed, per-tactic analysis is confined to only shortened URLs. The paper does not provide a similar quantitative breakdown or performance evaluation for other prevalent URL-based tactics like homograph attacks, subdomain spoofing, or the use of IP addresses within its primary evaluation datasets.",
    "evidence": "Page 23, Section 5.3, URL shortening: \"A shortened URL is a URL that has been shortened and made easier to use... Shortened URLs can redirect users to websites that may be harmful or malicious. A statistical analysis was conducted on shortened URLs in three distinct data sets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model on shortened URLs. Statistical data on shortened URLs in these datasets are presented in Table 12... All shortened URL addresses from the three datasets were consolidated into a unified dataset... The proposed model was trained and tested using this dataset, and the results demonstrate that the model can classify shortened URL addresses with 92.16% accuracy.\"\n\nPage 25, Table 12: \"Statistical data on the number of shortened URLs in the three datasets.\" This table provides a quantitative breakdown of shortened URLs found in the primary datasets.\n\nPage 25, Table 13: \"Classification metric values of the proposed model at Shortened URL Dataset.\" This table reports detailed performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC) specifically for the shortened URL dataset.\n\nPage 4, Section 3, Material and Methods: The description of the main datasets (GramBeddings, Malicious and Benign URLs, etc.) focuses on general statistics like URL counts and lengths, but lacks any breakdown by phishing tactic, indicating that the primary evaluation did not systematically account for tactic diversity beyond shortened URLs."
