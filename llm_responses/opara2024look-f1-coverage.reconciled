{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper explicitly discusses its model’s capability to handle multiple phishing tactics (e.g., URL spoofing via misspellings, homograph attacks using non-Latin characters, and cloned HTML content) through its tactic-agnostic design using character and word embeddings. However, it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation dataset by tactic nor report per-tactic detection performance, meeting the criteria for Medium coverage.","evidence":"Page 12, Section 6.2: “For example, suppose the URL is spoofed by misspelling the characters in the links or by using non-Latin characters to make homographic URLs… If the HTML content is cloned word for word, the proposed method will depend on the URL content to determine the maliciousness of the website.” \nPage 6, Section 4.2: “Our final corpus contained a balanced dataset of 45,373 phishing and benign instances.” No per-tactic distribution or per-tactic performance is provided."}
