{"value":"Medium","why":"The authors evaluate ΔPhish against a targeted evasion attack that manipulates the HTML features of phishing pages and demonstrate that their adversarial fusion scheme maintains over 70% detection at 1% false-positive rate even when up to 11 HTML features are modified. However, they do not evaluate robustness against other active evasion techniques within their claimed scope (e.g., dynamic content loading, JavaScript obfuscation beyond HTML feature changes, Base64-encoded scripts, or cloaking), and thus only demonstrate partial robustness within the HTML attack surface.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “We further show that the detection rate remains higher than 70% even under very sophisticated attacks carefully designed to evade our system.”; Page 14, Section 4.2 (Adversarial Evasion): “The results (Fig. 6, right) show… detection rate of maximum and adversarial fusion rules under attack remains higher than 70%.”"}
