{"value":"Medium","why":"While CANTINA+ does not provide per‐decision explanations (e.g., via SHAP, LIME, attention or rule traces), it does furnish global interpretability by measuring and reporting the predictive power of each of its 15 features (via AUC) and by analyzing which features (e.g., “bad forms,” “nonmatching URLs,” “page in top search results”) most strongly drive its classification performance. This satisfies the ‘Medium’ criterion of offering global or limited insight through feature importances.","evidence":"Page 19, Section 8.7 (“Learning with Individual Features”): “In this section, we evaluate the contribution of each single feature to the overall performance… Figure 4 shows that a few features clearly stand out… with over 0.85 AUC, including ‘bad forms,’ ‘bad action fields,’ ‘nonmatching URLs,’ and ‘page in top search results.’”"}
