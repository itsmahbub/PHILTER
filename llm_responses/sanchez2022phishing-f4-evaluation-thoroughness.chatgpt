{"value":"Medium","why":"The authors report class-sensitive metrics—precision, recall, and F1‐score—alongside accuracy, but they do not include any summary metric such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC. Thus, while some relevant metrics are provided, the evaluation lacks full coverage required for robust assessment under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 8, Section V.B: “We used the averaged values of 10-fold cross-validation, reporting the accuracy (Eq. (3)), the F1-Score (Eq. (4)), the precision (Eq. (1)) and the recall (Eq. (2))”; Table 6 reports Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy; no AUC-PRC/AUC-ROC/MCC provided."}
