    "why": "The proposed method relies on a feature set that is explicitly categorized into four distinct types: Address-Bar based, Domain-based, HTML and JavaScript-based, and Abnormal based features. This multi-faceted feature engineering approach suggests that the model is designed to capture signals from a variety of phishing tactics, including URL-based obfuscation (e.g., lexical manipulations), suspicious domain properties (e.g., newly registered domains), and content-based tricks (e.g., malicious scripts or forms). By incorporating features from these different sources, the method implicitly addresses multiple phishing strategies. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation dataset according to the phishing tactics present, nor does it report the detection performance for each specific tactic. The evaluation is presented in aggregate, which prevents a clear understanding of the method's effectiveness against the diverse landscape of phishing techniques.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III.A: \"The 30 independent features (See [15] for full details of features) are broadly distributed and categorized in four divisions namely: i. HTML and JavaScript-based features (having 5 of the 30 features). ii. Abnormal based features (having 6 of the 30 features). iii. Domain-based features (having 7 of the 30 features). iv. Address-Bar based features (having 12 of the 30 features).\" This quote demonstrates that the feature set is designed to cover multiple aspects of a phishing attack. However, the paper's evaluation section (Section IV) presents only overall performance metrics (Accuracy, FP, FN, F-measure) without any per-tactic analysis."
