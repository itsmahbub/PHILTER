{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper evaluates its phishing detection method using class-sensitive metrics—precision, recall, F1-score—and also reports accuracy and false positive rate. However, it does not include any of the required summary metrics (AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC) that are necessary to meaningfully assess performance under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 5.1: “We introduce metrics of Accuracy (Acc), FPR, Recall (Rec), Precision (Pre) and F1 score (F1) to evaluate the performance of classifiers.”  No AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC are reported."}
