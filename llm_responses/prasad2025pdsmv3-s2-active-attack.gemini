    "why": "The paper evaluates its proposed method using several standard, publicly available datasets of phishing and benign URLs. The methodology and experimental setup show no evidence of testing against active attacks or evasive techniques. The benchmarks are limited to classifying URLs from these static collections, which represent clean examples rather than instances of deliberate manipulation designed to bypass detectors. The paper discusses general challenges like 'vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks' in the introduction but does not include an evaluation of its own model's resilience to such threats. The evaluation focuses entirely on standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) on non-adversarial data.",
