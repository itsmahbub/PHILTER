    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a static, multi-layer stacked ensemble model that does not incorporate any mechanisms to adapt to concept drift, such as periodic retraining, online learning, or time-aware feature engineering. The evaluation, while using four distinct datasets from different years (2015, 2018, 2020), is conducted independently within each dataset. There is no temporal evaluation protocol, such as training the model on an older dataset and testing its performance on a newer one, to assess its resilience to evolving phishing tactics. The methodology and evaluation implicitly assume that the statistical properties of phishing attacks are stationary, which aligns with the criteria for a 'Low' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section IV-A, Paragraph 1: \"The proposed model is evaluated by applying on different datasets(D1,D2,D3,D4) with and without data balancing. The results with and without data balancing are shown with respect to different datasets. Table 2 shows the results of proposed model with dataset D1 with and without data balancing... Similary, proposed model is applied on D2 to detect phishing site. Table 3 gives the performance results of the proposed model... The results with D3 dataset is given in Table 4... Finally, the proposed model is applied on dataset D4 to result Table 5.\" This quote explicitly describes the evaluation protocol, confirming that the model is trained and tested on each dataset separately, rather than being tested across different time periods to measure its robustness against concept drift."
