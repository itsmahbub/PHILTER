{"value":"Low","why":"The PhiUSIIL framework requires transmitting and processing full, unfiltered URLs (including query parameters) and downloading entire webpage HTML content for feature extraction at inference time. No client-side or in-boundary deployment model is described, nor are any privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., URL hashing, federated learning, or anonymized features) mentioned.","evidence":"Section 3.1.1 (\"Once we get a new phishing URL, we download the webpage referred to by the PhishURL… A Java program is developed that takes PhishID and PhishURL as input to read the webpage referred by the PhishURL and save it locally\"), Section 4 (Phase 2 extracts URL features and HTML features for inference) — no privacy safeguards are described"}
