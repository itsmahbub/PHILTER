{"value":"Low","why":"PhishNot transmits full URLs (including all path segments and query parameters) from the client to an external cloud‐hosted service for inference, with no mention of any hashing, truncation, or anonymization. This exposes potentially sensitive data off‐device and offers no explicit privacy safeguards at inference time.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 3 (Deployment Stage): “the client captures the URL and sends it through an API call to the cloud‐based server… the URL is encoded using UTF‐8 encoding and then sent in a simple API call with the URL as an HTTP parameter.”\nPage 8, Section 5.8: “the server adopts a simple RESTful call method where the URL to be inspected is passed as a parameter to the server using the HTTP protocol.”"}
