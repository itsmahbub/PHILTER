{"value":"High","why":"The proposed system is tactic-agnostic by design—its core detection logic relies on identifying a brand from page content and verifying domain-brand consistency, which applies regardless of hosting environment or URL manipulation tactics. Moreover, the paper explicitly evaluates robustness against two distinct adversarial evasion tactics (“Webpage source perturbation” and “Noise perturbation on Logo”), provides a quantitative breakdown of detection performance for each tactic in Table IV, and reports per‐tactic Correct/Wrong/Error counts for each LLM. This fulfills the requirement for addressing multiple tactics with a per‐tactic performance report.","evidence":"Page 11, Section VII “ROBUSTNESS AGAINST ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS” (describing Adversarial Attack 1—Webpage source perturbation and Attack 2—Noise perturbation on Logo); Page 11, Table IV “Brand identification against adversarial samples” showing per‐tactic Correct/Wrong/Error counts for each model."}
