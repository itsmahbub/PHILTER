{"value":"High","why":"The final phishing/legitimate decision is made by a simple, transparent rule – comparing the query site’s domain to the domains returned by a Google Image Search of its logo – and this decision path can be trivially traced for each instance (i.e. exactly which logo was used, which domains were returned, and which mismatch drove the verdict). Although an SVM is employed earlier to extract the logo, the ultimate classification is not a black box and its per-decision reasoning is fully exposed, satisfying the “inherently interpretable model” criterion for High interpretability.","evidence":"Section 3.2 (page 21): “Consistent identity means that the real identity … can be obtained from the domain name of the query website. … a comparison … will enable us to differentiate a phishing from a legitimate website.”\nSection 3.2 (page 22): “If the comparisons return at least one match, our method will classify the query website as legitimate. Otherwise, it is classified as a phishing website.”"}
