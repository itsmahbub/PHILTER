    "why": "The proposed method, PhishIntention, requires the full URL, a screenshot of the webpage, and its HTML source code for analysis. The system design also includes a dynamic analysis component that emulates clicks and follows links, which necessitates active interaction with the live webpage. The paper's described deployment for its field study is a server-side, crawler-based system that processes URLs from a public feed (CertStream). There is no mention of how this system would be deployed to protect an individual end-user's privacy, such as in a browser extension. The fundamental data requirements of the method (full URL, visual content via screenshot, and source code) are inherently sensitive. If deployed in a user-facing environment, this data would need to be transmitted to a server for inference. The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving techniques like local inference, feature anonymization, or hashed lookups to mitigate this. The absence of any discussion of privacy safeguards for an end-user context categorizes this method as 'Low'.",
    "evidence": "Page 14, Section 10.1.3, System Design: \"Our crawler keeps crawling the URLs fed from CertStream as a “producer”... The URL, its HTML code and its screenshot are stored in a database node. Each phishing solution is deployed in a separate node as a “consumer” to predict on the webpages.\" This clearly describes a centralized, server-side architecture that collects full webpage data for analysis, rather than a client-side or privacy-preserving model. Furthermore, the core algorithm requires sensitive inputs, as shown on Page 5, Algorithm 1, which lists \"url, S, code\" (URL, Screenshot, HTML code) as direct inputs to the detection function."
