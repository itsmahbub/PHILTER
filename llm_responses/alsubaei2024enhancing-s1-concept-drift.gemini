    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper claims the proposed model is adaptable to the 'dynamic nature of deceptive actions' and 'changing phishing techniques'. However, the evaluation methodology does not validate this claim against concept drift. The study uses a static dataset from Kaggle and employs a standard 75/25 train-test split, as shown in its framework diagram. There is no temporal separation between the training and testing sets (e.g., training on older data and testing on newer data), which is the standard protocol for assessing resilience to evolving tactics. The method itself lacks explicit mechanisms for drift adaptation, such as continual learning or periodic retraining. Consequently, the evaluation implicitly assumes that the statistical properties of phishing attacks remain static over time.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Figure 1: The diagram of the proposed framework explicitly shows the data processing pipeline concluding with 'Data Splitting Train 75% and Test 25%', which indicates a standard random split rather than a temporal one.\n\nPage 5, Section III.A: The paper specifies the data source: 'The dataset, obtained from Kaggle [40], is specifically designed for the identification of phishing websites...'. Static public datasets like this typically lack the temporal metadata required for a proper concept drift evaluation.\n\nPage 2, Section I: The paper makes claims about adaptability: 'Another significant property of the framework is its ability to adapt to new inputs readily. Such adjustable functionality gradually boosts the algorithm's reliability by ensuring that the recognition approach remains effective in confronting the effects of changing phishing techniques and attributes.' However, the subsequent experimental setup does not provide evidence to support this specific claim in a real-world, evolving threat scenario."
