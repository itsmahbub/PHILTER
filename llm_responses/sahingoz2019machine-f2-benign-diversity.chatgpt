{"value":"Low","why":"The authors’ benign dataset consists solely of “highest ranked” pages obtained via the Yandex Search API (Section 4.1), i.e. popular, high-reputation sites. They do not include any low-reputation/long-tail domains (e.g. personal or recently registered sites) nor any explicit subset of benign pages embedding legitimate brand elements. Thus the evaluation lacks the required diversity of benign pages.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 4.1 Dataset: “To collect these pages, we got help from Yandex Search API…these words are sent to Yandex Search API to get the highest ranked web pages, which had a very low possibility to be phishing web pages.”"}
