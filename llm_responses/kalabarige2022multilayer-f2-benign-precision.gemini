    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper evaluates its model on four public datasets (D1 from UCI, D2-D4 from Mendeley) but fails to provide any details about the diversity of the benign (legitimate) websites within them. The description of the datasets is purely statistical, focusing on the number of features and instances, and the split between legitimate and phishing samples. There is no mention of the source or characteristics of the benign URLs, such as whether they include low-reputation or long-tail domains, or pages with legitimate use of third-party brand elements (e.g., social media login widgets, payment buttons). The evaluation does not address these challenging benign cases, which are critical for assessing a detector's real-world false positive rate. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a Medium or High rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III.A, DATASET: 'The proposed work applied on four datasets named as D1, D2, D3, D4. D1 is collected from UCI repository [17] and D2 is collected from mendely [20] with 48 features. Finally, D3 and D4 are also collected from mendely [30] where the dataset D3 contains 111 features with 58,645 instances, D4 contains with 111 features with 88,647 instances. Each dataset consists two classes such as phishing and legitimate.'\n\nPage 6, Table 1: The table provides descriptions like, 'It consists 30 features with 11055 instances. In which, 4898 are legitimate and 6157 are phishing.' This information is quantitative and gives no insight into the nature or diversity of the 4,898 legitimate pages."
