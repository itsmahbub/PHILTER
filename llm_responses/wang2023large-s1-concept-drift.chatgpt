{"value":"Low","why":"PhishBERT neither employs adaptive strategies to handle evolving phishing tactics nor evaluates its performance on temporally separated data splits. The experiments use static train–test splits drawn from the same time period and focus on reduced dataset size and few-epoch training rather than simulating concept drift or time-forward deployment.","evidence":"Page 3, Section 3.2 (‘We extract phishing URL data… scraped 2.19 million pieces of data … before April 2022… sampled 200,000 …’); Page 4, Section 4 Experiment Scenario (‘…unbalanced experimental scenario… reducing the training set size and training epoch…’)—no mention of training on earlier data and testing on later data or periodic/adaptive retraining."}
