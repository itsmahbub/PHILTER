{"value":"Medium","why":"Although the paper does not provide a per-tactic breakdown of its evaluation, its nine URL-based lexical features explicitly target multiple phishing tactics observable in URLs—such as subdomain spoofing (via “No. of top-level domain”), lexical obfuscation (via “No. of dots in URL” and “No. of delimiters in domain/path”), and length-based manipulations (via URL and path length features). However, because the authors do not categorize phishing instances by tactic or report per-tactic performance, the method meets the criteria for Medium but not High.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.3 (Features extraction):\n• “No. of top-level domain: It is observed that attackers use multiple top-level domains within a domain name.”\n• “No. of dots in URL: … phishing websites have comparatively more numbers of dots. Dots are usually used to misguide the legitimacy of the website.”\n• “No. of delimiter in a domain: … a dashed or a + symbol … can make a phishing URL look like a legitimate one.”\nPage 7, Section 4.3 (Dataset):\n• Describes use of ISCXURL-2016 without any labeling or breakdown by phishing tactic, and no per-tactic performance is reported."}
