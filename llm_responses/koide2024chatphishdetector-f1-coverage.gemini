    "why": "The paper's method is tactic-agnostic by design, using a Large Language Model's general reasoning abilities to detect social engineering and brand impersonation rather than relying on rules for specific tactics. The authors demonstrate a strong commitment to tactic diversity by creating a custom dataset that overcomes the limitations of existing ones, specifically including multilingual sites (22 languages), sites impersonating a wide range of brands (147 total), and, notably, sites that are not visual clones of legitimate pages. The paper provides a qualitative breakdown of the varied tactics the system can identify, such as fake security warnings, fake account issues, and urgent payment requests (Section V-G). Critically, it also provides a quantitative breakdown and reports detection performance for a specific, challenging tactic category: the 172 phishing sites in their dataset that 'did not closely resemble their legitimate sites,' for which the GPT-4/4V models achieved 100% detection.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section V-B, \"When analyzing the true positives in this data, GPT-4/GPT-4V successfully identified all 172 phishing sites (100%), while GPT-3.5 detected 171 phishing sites (99.4%). Our system demonstrated high accuracy in detecting these phishing sites by analyzing the context of brand impersonation and social engineering techniques, rather than relying solely on comparisons with legitimate sites using screenshot images.\"\n\nPage 6, Section IV-A, \"Phishing sites vary in design; some are exact clones of legitimate sites, while others have original content or incorporate elements such as layouts and logos from legitimate sites. These diverse phishing sites are difficult to detect using existing systems that rely primarily on image similarity to their legitimate sites. We identified 172 phishing sites (17.2%) in our dataset that did not closely resemble their legitimate sites.\"\n\nPage 12, Section V-G, \"EVIDENCE FOR IDENTIFYING PHISHING SITES\", This section details seven specific types of evidence (tactics) the models use for detection, including 'LEGITIMACY OF DOMAIN NAMES', 'FAKE SECURITY WARNING', 'FAKE ACCOUNT ISSUE', 'URGENT PAYMENT REQUEST', 'FAKE LOGIN ERROR', 'FAKE REWARD', and 'AUTHENTICATION REQUEST'."
