{"value":"High","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for each model in Table 1 and presents a ROC curve with AUC‐ROC values in Figure 5, thus including both detailed per‐class performance and a summary metric appropriate for imbalanced phishing detection.","evidence":"Table 1 (page 8, Section V-B1): “Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F-measure”; Figure 5 (page 10, Section V-B3): “ROC Curve for phishing classification … AUC values.”"}
