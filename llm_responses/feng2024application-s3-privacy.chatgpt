{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving deployment or data‐handling measures: there is no mention of client‐side inference, hashed URL lookups, federated learning, or anonymized feature representations, nor does it state that sensitive data (full URLs, page content or screenshots) remains on‐device. As a result, in deployment it is unclear whether raw features would be sent off‐device, indicating no safeguards.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 3.1 System architecture: “For the detection of an unknown website, the features are extracted first, and then put the feature into detection model to evaluate the benign or the phishing website.” (no further details on deployment or data transmission)"}
