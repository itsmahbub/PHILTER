{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed PhishingRTDS method does not include any evaluation of robustness against active evasion techniques within the URL‐based input modality. It only tests on clean phishing and benign URL datasets without considering manipulations such as obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, cloaking, deferred execution, or adversarial perturbations intended to bypass the detector.","evidence":"Section 4 (Experiments) – data collection and evaluation use only clean PhishingArmy/PhishTank and Alexa URLs; no mention of active/evasive attack testing throughout methodology (Section 3) or experiments."}
