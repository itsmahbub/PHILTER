{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method and evaluation focus on feature extraction, model architecture, and overall detection performance across datasets, but do not consider or evaluate across specific phishing tactics (e.g., HTTPS misuse, subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks). There is no information on tactic diversity in the Crawling2024 dataset, nor any per-tactic performance breakdown, indicating that tactic diversity is ignored.","evidence":"Section 5 (Experiments and analysis) and Table VIII present overall detection accuracy without any per-tactic breakdown; no section of the paper discusses handling or evaluation of varied phishing tactics such as URL redirection, homograph attacks, or use of IP addresses."}
