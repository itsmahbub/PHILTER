    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper proposes models based on Extra-Trees, an ensemble method using decision trees as base learners. Decision trees are inherently interpretable models, and the authors explicitly claim their methods are interpretable as a result. However, the paper provides no mechanism to generate per-decision explanations, such as tracing a classification through the ensemble's decision paths, nor does it employ any post-hoc XAI techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP). Furthermore, it does not even provide global explanations like feature importance rankings. The claim to interpretability rests solely on the nature of the underlying algorithm without demonstrating any practical means for auditing or explaining individual predictions, which aligns with the criteria for a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section V, CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK: \"In addition, this study presented AI phishing detection methods that are interpretable, unlike other black-box AI methods. The development of interpretable AI methods remains as a predominant concern in the AI community and the continuous contribution towards implementing interpretable AI models is essential.\"\nPage 5, Section III.B, EXPERIMENTAL FLOW CHART: \"In Figure 2, the first component is the algorithms box which houses four (4) meta-learners vis-à-vis AdaBoost.M1 [20], 21], LogitBoost [22], [23], Bagging [24], [25] and Rotation Forest [26], [27] algorithms and the base -learner which is the Extra Trees [28]–[30] algorithm.\"\nPage 10, Section V, CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK: \"In the future, we aim to consider other decision tree algorithms aside from the Extra-tree in other to produce an interpretable model.\" - This statement suggests that while the current model is claimed to be interpretable, further work is needed to produce a practically interpretable model, reinforcing the limitation."
