    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method, CatchPhish, is based on a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) architecture, which utilizes complex backbones like LSTMs, CNNs, or MLPs. These are inherently non-interpretable, or \"black box,\" models. The system's output is a numerical distance between an input term and known brand names. A classification is made by applying a threshold to this distance score. The paper provides no mechanism to explain why a particular distance score was produced or which features (characters or character patterns) of the input string most influenced the decision. The evaluation focuses exclusively on performance metrics like accuracy, training time, and F1-score, without discussing or implementing any methods for model interpretability, such as attention mechanisms or post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section IV: \"To identify the most efficient and adequate architecture for the problem situation, three different architectures were selected (i) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); (ii) Long-term memory network (LSTM); (iii) Multi-layer neural network (MLP), both with high feature extraction power.\"\n\nPage 5, Section D, Page rank: \"Analyzing the distances obtained by MDB, it is observed that the distance between the true mark and an identical term is equal to zero, while the distance between the true term and similar marks (typosquatting) varies between values greater than zero and less than 0.5. Therefore, we can infer that the terms belonging to the distance interval (0 < d < 0.5), are phishing of the brand being evaluated.\"\n\nPage 1, Abstract: \"CatchPhish uses a Siamese neural network capable of identifying the presence of typosquatting mentions in phishing pages. In the experiments, the proposed approach achieved 99.30% of assertiveness.\""
