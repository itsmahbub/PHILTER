    "why": "The paper explicitly addresses multiple modern phishing tactics, particularly visual evasion techniques that defeat traditional text-based methods. The authors design their approach to be robust against tactics like hiding brand names in embedded objects, splitting images into multiple parts, and rendering images using pure CSS. The evaluation dataset is built from real-world, recent phishing feeds (OpenPhish, PhishTank), which inherently includes a diversity of tactics. The dataset also includes less popular brands and non-English websites, further demonstrating an awareness of attack diversity. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the tactics present in the evaluation dataset, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. The evaluation is presented in aggregate for the entire phishing corpus.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.1: \"By relying on a screenshot of the web page (rather than relying only on features extracted from the web page), our approach is robust against resource evasion techniques, such as image splitting (Fig. 2) or the replacement of image resources by pure CSS.\"\n\nPage 3, Section 2.2: \"For instance, images can be decomposed into several parts and then displayed as if they belong to a single image; a reverse image search on each part might not allow finding the legitimate page. Fig. 2 shows an example of splitting image resources. Moreover, an adversary could convert images to pure cascading style sheets (CSS) [7] which results in no resources for reverse image lookup.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 4.2.1: \"The set of phishing web pages originate from 100,000 URLs that were posted in phishing feeds such as Open-Phish [25], PhishTank [30], and PhishStats [29] between September 2019 and December 2019. ... The dataset contains multiple languages such as English, Portuguese, Russian, and Japanese. Most non-English phishing web pages attacked international brands such as PayPal’s localized web site.\"\n\nPage 7, Sections 4.3 & 4.4: The performance evaluation in Tables 3 and 5 reports overall accuracy, precision, etc., for the entire phishing and benign datasets. There is no breakdown of performance against the specific evasion tactics the method was designed to counter."
