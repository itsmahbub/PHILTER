    "why": "The paper's method, PhishIntention, is designed to be robust against several key phishing tactics, and its evaluation is structured to explicitly measure this robustness. \n1) The method's design is inherently tactic-agnostic in some respects; by relying on computer vision to analyze webpage appearance and behavior, it is less susceptible to URL-based tactics or HTML obfuscation.\n2) The paper explicitly defines and evaluates its performance against multiple tactic categories: it uses dynamic analysis to handle multi-stage attacks where the initial page links to a credential-requiring page (CRP); it quantifies its robustness against HTML obfuscation, showing its vision-based classifier's accuracy is unaffected while a baseline's plummets; and it tests against 'misleading legitimacies' (benign pages with target logos), demonstrating a significantly lower false positive rate.\n3) The paper provides a quantitative breakdown of its dataset based on the credential-taking mechanism (direct vs. linked CRP) and reports specific performance metrics for each of the tested tactics, fulfilling all criteria for a high rating.",
    "evidence": "1. **HTML Obfuscation:** The paper explicitly tests against HTML obfuscation. Table 6 shows that PhishIntention's vision-based CRP classification accuracy remains at 95.0% after obfuscation, while a purely HTML-based method (Xdriver) drops from 75.4% to 59.2%. (Page 13, Section 9.2, Table 6: 'In contrast, PhishIntention largely preserves its classification and location accuracy even when its HTML heuristics are bypassed, thanks to the computer vision solution.')\n2. **Multi-stage Attacks (Redirection):** The system is designed to handle phishing pages that are not immediately credential-requiring but link to one. Table 1 provides a taxonomy of the dataset, showing 11.2% of phishing pages 'contain a link to a login/signup webpage'. The method's dynamic analysis component is specifically designed to address this tactic, and its performance is evaluated in Section 7. (Page 3, Section 1, Table 1)\n3. **Misleading Legitimacies:** The paper evaluates robustness against benign pages that contain logos of well-known brands (e.g., for single sign-on). Figure 15 shows PhishIntention achieves a false positive rate of 5.10% on a dedicated dataset of these pages, compared to 45.5%-60.1% for baselines. (Page 13, Section 9.2, Figure 15: 'Observe that, while the baselines suffer from high FPRs (45.5% to 60.1%, see Figure 15), the false-positive rate of PhishIntention is significantly much lower, i.e. 5.10%.')"
