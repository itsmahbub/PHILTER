{"value":"Medium","why":"While the paper reports class-sensitive metrics such as recall (true positive rate) and false positive rate, and presents ROC curves, it does not provide precision or F1-score in its main phishing detection evaluation, nor does it report any summary metric (e.g., AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC) with numeric values. Thus it includes some relevant metrics but lacks full coverage required under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 1641, Section 6.3: “Figure 11 plots the ROCs … At a low FPR of 10⁻³, PhishIntention achieves a recall of 0.9.” (No precision, F1-score, or AUC values are given.)"}
