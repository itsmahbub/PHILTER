{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates their detector on a single public dataset of 58 000 legitimate sites without any mention of including harder benign subsets such as low-reputation or long-tail domains, or pages with legitimate brand elements (e.g. PayPal/OAuth widgets, social media logos). Thus, the benign set appears limited to generic or popular domains, failing to capture the required diversity.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.1: “All of the characteristics are gathered from Phishing Websites Dataset… The dataset has 88 647 instances with 111 features and a labeled output column.” No further details on domain reputation or brand‐element usage are provided."}
