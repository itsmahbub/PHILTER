{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates the proposed phishing classifier only on clean, publicly available phishing and legitimate website data; it does not include any experiments or analyses of robustness against active evasion techniques (e.g. junk‐character insertion, obfuscated JavaScript, cloaking, or adversarial perturbations) within its URL‐based scope.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “The experiments are based on a public dataset of 58,000 legitimate websites and 30,647 phishing ones… The experimental results of our phishing websites detection (PWD) method indicate remarkable performances…”  No section of the paper describes testing against deliberate evasion or adversarial manipulations."}
