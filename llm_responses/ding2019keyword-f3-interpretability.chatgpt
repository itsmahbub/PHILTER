{"value":"Medium","why":"The SHLR method incorporates inherently interpretable components (the heuristic rule set) and uses logistic regression (an interpretable model) but does not provide per-decision explanations (e.g. feature‐level contributions or XAI techniques) for classifier decisions. Thus it offers global interpretability through its rules and model choice, but lacks traceability of individual predictions.","evidence":"Section 3.2 defines seven named rules (“Rule 1…Rule 7”) for transparent URL classification by pattern matching. Section 3.3 describes use of a logistic regression classifier but gives no mechanism (e.g. feature weights per decision or SHAP/LIME) to explain individual predictions."}
