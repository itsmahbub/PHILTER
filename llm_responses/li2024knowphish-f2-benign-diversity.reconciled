{"value":"Medium","why":"The evaluation’s benign set is drawn exclusively from Tranco top-50 k domains, so it does not include low-reputation or long-tail sites. However, the error analysis shows the benign pages do include legitimate third-party brand elements (e.g. embedded Nextcloud, FileGator, Bitly logos), which caused false positives. Thus only one of the two required diversity subsets is present, meeting the ‘Medium’ criterion.","evidence":"Page 10, Section 6.1: “benign samples are randomly collected from Tranco [46] top 50 k domains…”; Page 19, Appendix A.3: “false positive examples resulting from … web-hosting brands, such as file-hosting brands Nextcloud, FileGator, … Bitly.”"}
