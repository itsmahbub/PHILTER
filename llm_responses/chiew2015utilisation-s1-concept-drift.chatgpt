{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed method relies on inherently stable graphical features (website logos) rather than drift-prone signals, but the evaluation uses a static dataset without any training/test split across different time periods, so it meets one of the two criteria for high robustness but lacks temporal evaluation.","evidence":"Section 1 (Introduction): “Among the many elements within a website, a logo is the most suitable candidate because it is the official trademark and representative of a website… any mismatch is an indication of a phishing attack.”; Section 3.3 (Experimental results): “We have constructed two non-overlapping datasets from a total of 1140 webpages… Phishing webpages are downloaded from PhishTank and legitimate webpages are from Alexa…” (no mention of time-based split)"}
