{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving deployment or data-handling mechanisms. It processes full URLs (including all tokens and parameters) through a Tiny-BERT encoder and stacking classifier, with no mention of on-device inference, hashed lookups, URL sanitization, or anonymized feature vectors. Hence, sensitive URL data would be sent unfiltered for external inference.","evidence":"Page 2238, Section III.A “we tokenize each URL string into a vector of length 100… After the URL text is segmented and mapped into a numeric vector, Bert starts the feature extraction process.”  No client-side or privacy safeguards are mentioned anywhere in the methodology or deployment discussion."}
