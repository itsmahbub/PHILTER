{"value":"Low","why":"The method exclusively relies on visual similarity between screenshots of a fixed set of known targets and phishing pages, without considering or evaluating the broad range of real-world tactics (e.g., URL obfuscation, hosting on shared or compromised domains, homograph attacks) and provides no per-tactic performance breakdown.","evidence":"Page 1 Abstract & Introduction: “given a screenshot of a web page, we want to decide whether it is a possible phishing attempt to a well known website for which we have stored the screenshots.”\nPage 3 Section IV (Methodology) and Section V (Results): no mention of multiple phishing tactics or per-tactic evaluation; only precision@k and recall@k on a single screenshot-matching dataset."}
