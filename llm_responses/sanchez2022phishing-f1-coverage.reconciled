{"value":"High","why":"The paper both explicitly identifies more than four distinct real-world phishing tactics and provides a quantitative breakdown of phishing examples per tactic on a real-world dataset. In Section VI.C the authors perform a domain-frequency analysis of their 30K phishing URLs, manually categorize the top domains into six tactic groups (Free subdomain hosting, Cloud services, Fake form platforms, Standalone/compromised domains, Social media, Malware blog posts), and report the counts for each in Table 8. This fulfills the ‘High’ requirement of (a) explicit coverage of ≥4 tactics and (b) real-world evaluation with quantitative, per-tactic breakdown.","evidence":"Section VI.C (pp. 9–10): “Trying to look for phishing categories, we performed a term frequency analysis… resulting in the six categories reflected in Table 8.”\nTable 8 (p. 10): Lists six tactic categories ('Free subdomain', 'Cloud services', 'Fake form', 'Standalone domains', 'Social media', 'Malware blog posts') with counts (e.g., 000webhostapp 1415 under Free subdomain, docs.google 713 under Fake form, etc.)."}
