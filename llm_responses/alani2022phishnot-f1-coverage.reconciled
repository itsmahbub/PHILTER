{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishNot’s design incorporates multiple URL-based tactics—such as detecting newly registered domains via time_domain_activation and structural obfuscation via directory_length and qty_slash_directory—demonstrating that it addresses several phishing strategies. However, the evaluation treats all phishing URLs as a single class and does not provide a quantitative breakdown of tactics in the dataset or per-tactic performance, so it meets the criteria for Medium coverage.","evidence":"Table 3 (p. 7): Lists features like qty_dot_domain, directory_length, qty_slash_directory, time_domain_activation, which target different URL-based tactics.  Section 6.2 (p. 8): “The feature time_domain_activation…is a strong indicator of phishing domains… The remaining three features…include the number of ‘/’ in the directory part… the length of the file name, and the length of the directory part.”  Section 4 (p. 4): Dataset description with no per‐tactic breakdown and Section 5: aggregate performance metrics only."}
