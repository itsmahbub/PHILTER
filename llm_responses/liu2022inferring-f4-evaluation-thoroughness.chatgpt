{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports recall and false positive rates (and plots ROC curves) to evaluate phishing detection performance, but does not provide key class-sensitive metrics such as precision or F1-score, nor does it report any summary metric (e.g., AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC). Thus, it includes some relevant metrics but lacks full metric coverage under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 1641, Section 6.3: “Figure 11 plots the ROCs … At a low FPR of 10⁻³, PhishIntention achieves a recall of 0.9.” No precision, F1-score, or AUC values are reported."}
