{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates the proposed Tiny-BERT stacking model only on a clean, static URL dataset (balanced phishing vs. benign samples) using traditional metrics (accuracy, recall, FPR, F1). There is no discussion or experimental evaluation of active evasions—such as obfuscated URLs (junk characters, Base64 encoding), dynamic content loading, cloaking, or adversarially perturbed URLs—within its URL-only modality. Thus, it provides no evidence of robustness against any active attacks.","evidence":"Page 2240, Section IV.A (“Data Set and Evaluation Metrics”): “Our data set is from Kaggle…, contains a total of 549 346 URLs… we divided the data set into training set and test set at a ratio of 8:2.” No experiments or metrics address any active/evasive manipulations."}
