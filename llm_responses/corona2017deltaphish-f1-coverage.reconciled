{"value":"Low","why":"DeltaPhish is designed solely to detect phishing pages hosted on compromised legitimate websites and does not consider any of the other common phishing tactics (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, lexical manipulations). Furthermore, the evaluation employs a single dataset of pages exclusively from compromised sites and provides no quantitative breakdown or per-tactic performance analysis. Under the codebook criteria, this corresponds to a “Low” rating, since there is no information on phishing tactic diversity in the evaluation.","evidence":"Page 1–2, Abstract/Introduction: “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that specifically leverages this adversarial behavior [website compromise] for detection purposes.”\nPage 12, Section 4.1 (Dataset): “Our dataset consists of 5,511 distinct webpages, 1,012 of which are phishing pages, all collected from compromised websites.” No other phishing tactics or per-tactic results are reported."}
