{"value":"Medium","why":"While the paper reports class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and provides ROC and precision–recall curves, it does not report any numeric summary metric (e.g. AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC) necessary to quantify overall performance under class imbalance as required by the codebook.","evidence":"Section 4.4 (page 6): Describes use of precision, recall, F1, accuracy, ROC and precision–recall curves. Table 3 (page 8): Reports only Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score—no AUC or MCC values."}
