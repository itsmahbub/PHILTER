    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation of benign pages includes both low-reputation domains and pages with legitimate brand element usage. While the primary, large-scale evaluation for false positive rate uses a standard dataset of high-reputation sites (top-ranked Alexa list), the authors conduct a crucial secondary experiment to discover phishing \"in the wild.\" For this, they use CertStream, a feed of newly registered (and thus low-reputation) domains. In their analysis of false positives from this experiment, they specifically identify, discuss, and evaluate their system's performance on a challenging subset of benign pages they term \"plausible websites.\" These are pages from the CertStream feed that legitimately use logos of major brands like Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn for purposes like Single Sign-On (SSO) or advertising. By explicitly sourcing and evaluating on this difficult subset that combines both low-reputation domains and legitimate brand element usage, the paper provides a robust assessment of its false positive performance beyond simple, high-reputation websites.",
    "evidence": "Page 14, Section 6.4.2, \"Benign websites with logos of big company. We also observe that Phishpedia sometimes mistakes a benign website having a logo of a large well-known company such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. We refer to them as plausible websites for Phishpedia. Such logos appear for the purposes of advertisement or Single Sign-On (SSO) used for convenient registration.\"\n\nPage 15, discussion following Figure 20, \"In order to further evaluate how Phishpedia perform on these plausible webpages, we additionally collected 131,975 URLs from CertStream, and experimented Phishpedia on the webpages with logos of Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn. As a result, we found 47 (0.036%) such webpages, and our manual validation confirms that four of them are real phishing webpages.\"\n\nPage 12, Section 6.1, \"We use CertStream service [2] which contains new domains registered from Certificate Transparency Log Network...In this experimental study, we use this service to retrieve emerging new domains.\""
