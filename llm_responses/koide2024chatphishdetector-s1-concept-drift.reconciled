{"value":"Medium","why":"ChatPhishDetector relies on inherently stable, high-level features—brand impersonation, semantic and visual cues of social engineering—that are less prone to concept drift, even though it does not perform temporal evaluations or adaptive retraining. This design choice meets the codebook’s criterion for ‘Medium’ (avoiding volatile features by design), but the lack of time-separated testing prevents a ‘High’ rating.","evidence":"• Page 3, Section III: “By leveraging LLMs pre-trained on extensive data…without requiring specific learning from collected phishing sites.”\n• Page 6, Section IV.A: “From March to April 2023, we collected URLs…(single time window, no temporal split).”"}
