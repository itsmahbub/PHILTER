    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper demonstrates robustness against a specific subset of active attacks relevant to its URL-based modality, namely URL shortening. The authors explicitly create a dedicated \"Shortened URL Dataset\" by extracting all shortened URLs from their primary datasets. They then train and test their model specifically on this collection of evasive URLs, reporting a test accuracy of 92.16%. This constitutes a direct evaluation against an active evasion technique. However, the evaluation is limited to only this single type of attack. The paper does not assess the model's resilience against other relevant URL-based attacks, such as character-level obfuscation (e.g., using URL encoding, Punycode), adversarial character insertion/substitution, or complex subdomain manipulation. Therefore, it demonstrates partial robustness but not against a diverse set of attacks, fitting the criteria for a \"Medium\" rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 23, Section 5.3, URL shortening: \"A statistical analysis was conducted on shortened URLs in three distinct data sets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model on shortened URLs... All shortened URL addresses from the three datasets were consolidated into a unified dataset, designated as the 'Shortened URL Dataset'. This consolidated dataset encompasses 72,854 shortened URLs in total... The proposed model was trained and tested using this dataset, and the results demonstrate that the model can classify shortened URL addresses with 92.16% accuracy. Table 13 illustrates the classification metric results obtained from the training and testing process with the URL Shortening Dataset.\"\n\nPage 25, Table 13: The table, titled \"Classification metric values of the proposed model at Shortened URL Dataset,\" explicitly shows the performance results (Test Accuracy: 0.9216, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC) for the model when evaluated on the dataset composed solely of shortened URLs."
