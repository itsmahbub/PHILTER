    "why": "The underlying phishing detectors that the proposed method (POC) aims to harden use a feature set that inherently covers multiple phishing tactics. The features, listed in Table 2, are drawn from URL structure, reputation signals (REP), and HTML content. This includes features like 'Fake HTTPS' (for HTTPS misuse), 'Dots number' (for subdomain spoofing), 'Shortener' (for redirection), and 'Domain Age' (for newly created domains), demonstrating consideration for tactic diversity. The proposed POC defense is itself tactic-agnostic by design, transforming the feature space through mathematical operations to increase robustness against adversarial manipulation, regardless of the specific phishing tactic being employed. \n\nHowever, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation datasets by the phishing tactics they contain, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. While it qualitatively identifies the specific nature of the DeltaPhish dataset (compromised legitimate websites), this analysis is not systematically applied across all datasets or a wider range of tactics. Therefore, it addresses multiple tactics but lacks the per-tactic breakdown required for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Table 2, \"List of Features Included the LNU – Phish Dataset\": The table shows a diverse set of features used for detection, which are capable of capturing various tactics: \"URL-features (IP address, '@' (at) symbol, '-' (dash) symbol, Dots number, Fake HTTPS, URL Length, Redirect, Shortener), REP-features (SSL final state, URL/DNS mismatch, Domain Age), HTML-features (SFH, Anchors, iFrame, etc.).\"\n\nPage 6, Section 5.1, \"Formal Description of POC\": The core defense mechanism is described as transforming features using a set of mathematical operators: \"In our implementation, we use Fmop = {log,sin,cos,tan, exp², +,-,*,/} as our feature mapping operators...\". This approach is inherently tactic-agnostic as it operates on the feature values without regard for the specific tactic they represent.\n\nPage 14, Section 7.4, \"Takeaway Message\": The paper acknowledges tactic diversity in one of its datasets: \"In contrast, on the DeltaPhish dataset, using POC to harden the best baseline PD is not recommended... This is due to the specialized nature of the DeltaPhish dataset: while the other three datasets have malicious samples corresponding to 'general' phishing webpages, the DeltaPhish dataset captures a specific type of phishing attack. The entries in DeltaPhish are ‘legitimate’ webpages that have fallen under the control of an attacker...\""
