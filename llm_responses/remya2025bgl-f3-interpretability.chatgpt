{"value":"Low","why":"The paper proposes a black-box ensemble combining BERT, GNN, and LightGBM but does not provide any mechanism—neither inherently interpretable models nor post-hoc XAI methods—to explain individual classification decisions or surface feature contributions.","evidence":"Pages 7–8, Section D (“Ensemble Mechanism: Multi-Faceted Decision Making”): describes weighted voting of model outputs without any attribution or explanation mechanism. No mention elsewhere of SHAP, LIME, attention/gradient‐based heatmaps, decision paths, or feature importance analyses."}
