{"value":"Low","why":"The paper trains and tests models on randomly partitioned static datasets without any time-based train–test splitting or adaptive learning to handle evolving phishing tactics. There is no mention of continual learning, periodic retraining, or evaluation on chronologically newer data to assess robustness to concept drift.","evidence":"Section 4.4 (page 7): “70% samples in 2K-PD dataset are selected as the training set, while the remaining ones are for testing.”\nSection 4.5 (page 8): “The evaluations are conducted on the 50K-PD dataset, which is divided into a training set consisting of 70% data samples, and a test set containing the rest ones.”"}
