{"value":"Medium","why":"While PhishIntention is shown to be robust against several active evasion techniques within its scope—HTML form/URL obfuscation (Table 6), gradient-based adversarial perturbations (Table 7–8), and deferred-execution via dynamic CRP-transition analysis—it does not evaluate other relevant active attacks observable in its screenshot-and-interaction modality (e.g. invisible elements, junk HTML insertion, visual spoofing beyond logo obfuscation, or cloaking behavior). Thus it demonstrates partial but not full coverage of the active-attack surface for its claimed input types.","evidence":"Section 9.2 (p. 13): Table 6 ‘Robustness Against HTML Obfuscation’; Section 9.2 (p. 13): ‘all models … are robust against I-FGSM, I-StepLL, C&W L2, DeepFool, and DAG’; Section 4.4 (p. 7): dynamic analysis for deferred execution; Section 10.1.3 (p. 14): VPN-based mitigation against cloaking (no systematic evaluation)."}
