{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper explicitly introduces and evaluates a feature (HF7) to detect “image-based phishing,” where attackers replace all textual content with a single background image—an active evasion within the HTML modality. It also includes URL‐obfuscation features (UF1–UF4) and hyperlink‐manipulation features (HF3–HF6, HF8) that counter common adversarial tricks. However, it does not evaluate against more advanced evasions (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, Flash, junk HTML, or dynamic loading), and the authors acknowledge these gaps in their limitations. Thus the method shows partial robustness against a subset of active attacks in its scope.","evidence":"Page 12, Section 3.1.3 Point 7 (HF7 – Image‐based Phishing); Page 20–21, Section 7 “Limitations”: “It also fails to detect phishing sites containing embedded objects such as javascript, flash and HTML files…”"}
