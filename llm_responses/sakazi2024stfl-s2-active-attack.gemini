    "why": "The paper does not evaluate the proposed method against active attacks relevant to its input modality. The method is URL character-based, making it susceptible to attacks like URL obfuscation or adversarial character manipulation. However, the evaluation is conducted on standard benchmark datasets (CPURNN, PDRCNN, Khramtsova et al.) which are collections of known phishing and benign URLs, with no indication that they contain adversarial or evasive examples.\n\nThe 'Security Risks' discussion section focuses on threats against the federated learning (FL) process, such as model poisoning ('label-flipping attacks', 'backdoor attacks') by malicious participants, rather than evasive phishing attacks designed to bypass the classifier. The paper's threat model considers malicious FL clients, not malicious phishers crafting evasive URLs. Therefore, there is no demonstrated resistance to active phishing attacks.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section D, Security Risks: \"Similar to previous state-of-the-art research, which combined FL to detect malicious URLs (among them phishing) [25], we assumed that all participating users in the FL process are non-malicious users. However, a possible threat model scenario is to be considered in which adversaries could manipulate the parameters of the global model by manipulating the local models’ parameters during the updating process.\" This quote confirms the threat model is focused on attacks against the FL training protocol by malicious participants, not on the robustness of the detector against evasive phishing URLs from external attackers.\nPage 4, Section V.A, Datasets: \"CPURNN dataset [3] contains more than two million URLs... PDRCNN dataset [49] contains approximately 500,000 URLs... Dataset Khramtsova et al. [25] Approximately 700K samples of benign and malicious URLs...\" The experimental design relies on these standard datasets without any mention of testing against manipulated or obfuscated URLs designed to evade detection."
