{"value":"High","why":"PhishLLM is tactic-agnostic by design and demonstrates quantitative evaluation across multiple real-world phishing strategies. The paper not only handles diverse tactics—such as hosting on shared services, SSO redirects, domain aliases, homograph and adversarial attacks—but also reports specific performance metrics for each case (e.g., brand recall on low-ranked domains, 0% false positives on a domain-alias dataset, robustness against HTML obfuscation and gradient attacks, and a breakdown of failure cases by tactic).","evidence":"Section 3.1.4 (hosted domains, SSO redirection, domain aliases); Table 4 (0.70 recall on low-ranked Alexa brands; 0% FP on 300 domain aliases); Table 5 (post-attack recall under FGSM, BIM, DeepFool, HTML obfuscation); Section 5 (failure-case breakdown: 53% cryptocurrency phishing, 15% cloaking, etc.)"}
