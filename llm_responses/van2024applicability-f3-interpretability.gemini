    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper proposes a hybrid framework that combines predictions from three separate deep learning models (for URL, HTML content, and DOM tree), which are inherently black-box. The interpretability of the system is not at the feature level (like SHAP or LIME), but at the model level. The authors argue that the stacking function provides transparency by offering insights into how the individual models' predictions contribute to the final decision. This allows an analyst to see which modality (e.g., URL or HTML content) triggered the detection. Furthermore, the paper explicitly evaluates inherently interpretable models like Decision Trees and Logistic Regression as stacking functions, noting their value in providing transparency. This constitutes a form of limited, model-level insight rather than a pure black-box approach, aligning with the 'Medium' criteria.",
