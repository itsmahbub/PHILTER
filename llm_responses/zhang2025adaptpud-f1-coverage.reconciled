{"value":"Medium","why":"AdaptPUD is clearly designed to be tactic-agnostic—its Token-Property Embedding captures both semantic and structural URL features to address varied phishing evasion strategies. However, the evaluation only reports performance on two broad categories (general vs. tailored deceptive P-URLs) and does not provide a quantitative, per-tactic breakdown (e.g., subdomain spoofing vs. homograph attacks vs. link-shortener abuse). Thus it meets the criteria for “Medium.”","evidence":"Page 10, Section 5.4 (Practical application): “we collected 30 active P-URLs … categorizing them into two groups: general P-URLs and tailored deceptive P-URLs … AdaptPUD performs exceptionally well across both categories.” No further per-tactic performance is reported."}
