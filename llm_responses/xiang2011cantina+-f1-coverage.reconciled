{"value":"High","why":"CANTINA+’s feature set explicitly targets more than four distinct real-world phishing tactics (e.g. IP-address URLs, embedded domains/subdomain spoofing, lexical tricks like sensitive words and out-of-position TLDs, deceptive HTML forms, brand-agnostic search checks) and its evaluation is performed on genuine phishing pages from PhishTank. Crucially, the paper provides a quantitative, per-tactic breakdown of how many phishing examples exhibit each tactic (Table VI), satisfying the high tier requirement for both design coverage and per-tactic validation.","evidence":"Design: Section 6.1 (pp. 9–10) “URL-Based Features”, listing features for Embedded domain, IP address, Suspicious URL, Out-of-position TLD, etc.  Evaluation Breakdown: Table VI, p. 24 “Performance of the Binary Features…” shows the TP (%) for each feature, e.g. IP address 10.50%, Embedded domain 20.05%, thereby giving per-tactic proportions in the real-world phishing corpus."}
