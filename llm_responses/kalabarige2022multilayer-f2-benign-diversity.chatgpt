{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates its detector exclusively on standardized public datasets (UCI and Mendeley variants) without any indication that the benign pages include low-reputation/long-tail domains or legitimate brand-element usage. No subset of personal or recently registered domains, nor pages embedding third-party widgets or logos, is described; thus it omits the harder benign cases required for true robustness.","evidence":"Section III.A (page 5): “The proposed work applied on four datasets named as D1, D2, D3, D4. D1 is collected from UCI repository and D2 is collected from Mendeley … Each dataset consists two classes such as phishing and legitimate.” No mention of low-reputation domains or brand widgets."}
