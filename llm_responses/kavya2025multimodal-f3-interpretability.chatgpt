{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed framework comprises complex deep and graph neural network models (MM-HFN, TGNN-Att, FGCL-Net, MMTHF-Net) without any provision for interpreting individual predictions or understanding feature contributions. There is no mention of post-hoc XAI methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients) nor any inherently interpretable components or per-decision explanation mechanism.","evidence":"Abstract (p.1): “Our work proposes four brand‐new methods: …” —focuses on accuracy and adaptability, with no reference to explanations or interpretability. Section III, Proposed Model Design (pp.4–9): describes model architectures and equations, but contains no discussion of interpretability or explanation techniques."}
