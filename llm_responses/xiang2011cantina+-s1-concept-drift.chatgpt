{"value": "High", "why": "CANTINA+ explicitly incorporates periodic retraining via a two-week sliding window to adapt to newly emerging phishing variants and validates its performance by training on earlier data and testing on chronologically later samples, demonstrating resilience to concept drift.", "evidence": "Page 1 (Abstract): “In the time-based evaluation, CANTINA+ also achieved over 92% TP on unique testing phish … under 20% training phish with a two-week sliding window.”; Page 10 (Section 7.3): “In the time-based strategy … we moved a sliding window of length L … trained our models on the past data and tested them on future data.”"}
