{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper explicitly states that PhishingRTDS is designed to detect multiple phishing tactics—TinyURLs, Browsers-in-the-Browser (BiTB), and regular URL-based attacks—thus acknowledging the presence of diverse tactics in its evaluation. However, it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of how many samples of each tactic are in the test set, nor does it report detection performance separately for each tactic. This meets the ‘Medium’ criterion but not the ‘High’ criterion.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “In this paper, we design a system that detects three types of phishing attacks: Tiny Uniform Resource Locators (TinyURLs), Browsers in the Browser (BiTB), and regular phishing attacks.”; Page 7 (Section 4.1): “They contain phishing attacks that rely on abusing the subdomain with a random word, and some URLs are small URLs that the hostname itself is a phishing URL.”; No per-tactic dataset breakdown or per-tactic performance metrics are reported."}
