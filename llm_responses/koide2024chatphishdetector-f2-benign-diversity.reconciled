{"value":"Low","why":"The benign evaluation set comprises only official homepages/login pages of targeted brands and a random sample from the Tranco top-2000 list, all of which are high-reputation/popular domains. The paper does not include low-reputation or long-tail domains, nor does it include benign pages that embed third-party brand elements (e.g., small sites with PayPal or social-login widgets). Hence, neither of the two diversity criteria is met, resulting in a “Low” rating."," evidence":"Section IV.B (“Non-Phishing Sites”): “The seed URLs consisted of legitimate websites for the 153 brands targeted by phishing sites, as well as the top 2 k domain names from the Tranco list.”"}
