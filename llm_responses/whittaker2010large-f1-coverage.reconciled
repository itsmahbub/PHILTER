{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper explicitly identifies and quantifies multiple phishing tactics in its evaluation dataset—URL-based tactics (e.g., IP‐address hosts, long hostnames), hosting‐based tactics (ASNs, geolocations), and content‐based tactics (password fields, TF–IDF terms)—but does not report detection performance broken down by each tactic. This satisfies the “Medium” criterion: presence of multiple tactics is documented, but no per‐tactic performance metrics are provided.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 3.2.2: “One feature this process extracts is whether the URL contains an IP address for its hostname... Another feature this process extracts is whether the page has many host components.”\nPage 9, Table 3: Statistics for URL characteristics (IP hosts, long hostnames) quantifying tactic presence in phishing vs. non-phishing pages.\nPage 11, Section 4.3: Overall precision/recall metrics are reported with no per‐tactic breakdown of detection performance."}
