    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation of benign pages partially addresses diversity. It includes pages with legitimate, but potentially confusing, brand element usage, which is one of the key criteria for a robust evaluation. The error analysis explicitly mentions false positives caused by misidentifying advertisement logos or logos from web-hosting services on benign pages. This indicates the dataset contains these challenging cases. However, the evaluation fails to meet the other key criterion: inclusion of low-reputation or long-tail domains. The benign dataset is explicitly sourced from \"Tranco top 50k domains,\" which consists of popular, well-established sites rather than a diverse set including small businesses, personal domains, or recently registered sites. Since only one of the two specified diversity criteria is met, the evaluation is categorized as 'Medium'.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 6.1, Datasets: \"We utilize two datasets for our main phishing detection experiments. 1) TR-OP: A manually labeled and balanced dataset where the benign samples are randomly collected from Tranco [46] top 50k domains...\"\n\nPage 14, Section 8.1, Error Analysis: \"Finally, most remaining false positives align with common issues outlined in previous studies, such as the misidentification of an advertisement's logo as the primary logo [33, 34].\"\n\nPage 19, Appendix A.3, False Positives Analysis in Field Study: \"Figure 12 shows a few false positive examples resulting from the inclusion of web-hosting brands, such as file-hosting brands Nextcloud, FileGator, and a domain hosting brand Bitly. These benign webpages display the logos of web-hosting brands simply because they utilize their services, not because they are conducting phishing attacks. However, the RBPDs mistakenly report them as phishing due to the inconsistency between the logos and their legitimate domains.\""
