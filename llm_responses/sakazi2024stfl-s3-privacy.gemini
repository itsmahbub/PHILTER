    "value": "High",
    "why": "The proposed method, STFL, is explicitly designed using a Federated Learning (FL) framework to preserve user privacy. The core methodology involves training a local autoencoder model on each user's device using their unlabeled URL data. This data never leaves the device. Only the trained local model parameters (weights of the Bi-LSTM autoencoder) are sent to a central server for aggregation into a global model. This approach of sharing only model updates instead of raw user data is a key privacy-preserving mechanism and is specifically listed as a criterion for a 'High' rating in the codebook.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"...train a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) autoencoder network across multiple decentralized edge devices (using FL) containing unlabeled data samples without sharing them (the process is privacy-preserving). A centralized server collects the updated Bi-LSTM autoencoder networks from the users’ devices and aggregates them...\"\n\nPage 1, Section I, Introduction: \"In FL, users train a global model jointly by sharing just the local models with the server. The users’ data remains on their devices, and their data’s privacy are preserved [27], [30], [37].\"\n\nPage 4, Table I, Challenge: Users' privacy: \"Our method uses a straightforward FL environment. Only the local model parameters from each user's device are shared to the central server to preserve data privacy.\"\n\nPage 4, Section IV, Description of Algorithm 1: \"During the entire process, the data does not leave the user's device; only the updated model's parameters are sent between the user's device and the server.\""
