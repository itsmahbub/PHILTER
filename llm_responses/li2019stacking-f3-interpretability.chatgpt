{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed stacking model is a complex ensemble of GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM without any per‐decision explanation mechanism (e.g., no LIME/SHAP or decision‐path extraction). However, the authors do provide global insights into model behavior by reporting feature importances (Fig. 10), satisfying the criterion for Medium interpretability.","evidence":"Section 4.8 (page 34): “We use the importance coefficient of the features in GBDT to visualize the importance of the features as shown in Fig. 10, from which we can observe that the top‐3 important features are …”"}
