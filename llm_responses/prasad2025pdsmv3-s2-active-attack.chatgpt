{"value":"Low","why":"The paper only evaluates the proposed URL-based detector on clean, benchmark phishing vs. benign datasets using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, FPR) and does not include any tests against active evasion techniques (e.g. adversarial URL manipulations, obfuscated scripts, junk HTML, invisible elements, dynamic content loading, or cloaking).","evidence":"Page 9, Section 4.3 Evaluation metrics: “A variety of evaluation metrics, including false positive rate (FPR), accuracy (A), recall (R), F1 score and precision (P), were introduced to assess the effectiveness of the model that was suggested.”"}
