{"value":"Medium","why":"The SHLR method relies on an external Baidu search engine—sending the webpage’s title tag content off-device for lookup—and performs external DNS and WHOIS queries using the domain name. It does not transmit full, unfiltered URLs or page content, but it does send sanitized snippets (the title tag and domain) to external servers for inference, without employing explicit privacy-preserving mechanisms such as hashing or local-only processing.","evidence":"Abstract (p.1): “the title tag content of the webpage is input as search keywords to the Baidu search engine”  ; Section 3.1 (p.7): “Search engine–based detection phase … Take the title tag as the search keyword”"}
