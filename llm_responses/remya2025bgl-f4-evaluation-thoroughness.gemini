    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation that fully aligns with the requirements for a high-quality assessment of a phishing detection system. It explicitly defines and reports all necessary class-sensitive metrics: precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, it includes a summary metric, ROC-AUC, to assess the overall discriminatory power of the model. This combination ensures a robust evaluation that is sensitive to the challenges of class imbalance, measuring the model's ability to minimize both false positives and false negatives.",
    "evidence": "Page 16, TABLE 4, \"Performance comparison of individual models and hybrid model.\": This table explicitly reports values for Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC for the proposed BGLPhishNet model and its individual components. The inclusion of all these metrics is also stated in the text. For example, on page 12, section 'A. PERFORMANCE METRICS', the paper defines Accuracy, Precision, and Recall, and on page 13, it continues by defining F1-Score and ROC-AUC."
