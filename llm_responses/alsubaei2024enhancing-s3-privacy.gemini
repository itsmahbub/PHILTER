    "why": "The paper describes a complex deep learning model (RNT-J) that is trained and evaluated in an offline, lab-based setting on a static dataset. The feature engineering process requires access to full URLs and, implicitly, webpage content to calculate attributes like 'AbnormalFormAction' or 'PctExtResourceUrls'. The paper provides no details on its deployment architecture or how it would handle user data during live inference. There is no mention of any client-side processing, secure in-boundary deployment (e.g., at a network gateway), or the use of privacy-preserving techniques like URL hashing, federated learning, or anonymized feature vectors. The entire focus is on model accuracy and performance in a simulated environment. The absence of any discussion regarding inference-time data handling implies that a user's full URL and potentially webpage content would need to be sent to a centralized server for analysis, which poses a significant privacy risk.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III.A, DATASET DESCRIPTION: 'In this study, our focus revolves around a meticulously curated dataset comprising 10,000 instances, each characterized by various attributes associated with URLs and web pages. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle [40], is specifically designed for the identification of phishing websites...' This establishes that the work is based on an offline dataset, and the paper never describes a live deployment architecture. \n\nPage 7, Table 2, Summary of features in the phishing detection dataset: The feature list includes attributes such as 'NumQueryComponents', 'DoubleSlashInPath', and 'AbnormalFormAction', which necessitate parsing the full URL and webpage content, respectively. This indicates that sensitive user data would need to be collected for feature extraction.\n\nPage 12, Section V, SIMULATION RESULTS: 'During this stage, TensorFlow was used within IDE enviroment of Google-Colab setting by using the powerful processing unit resources... The implementation was carried out in the Python programming language within the Spyder IDE from the Anaconda distribution.' This confirms the research was conducted entirely in a development environment, with no information on how the model would be deployed or handle data for real-world users."
