{"value":"Low","why":"The paper presents accuracy evaluations only on clean phishing vs. benign URL datasets (PhishTank, ISCX-URL2016, Kaggle) without any adversarial or evasive manipulations (e.g. injected junk characters, obfuscated scripts, dynamic content, cloaking). There is no testing or discussion of robustness against active attacks within the URL modality, matching the “Low” criterion.","evidence":"Section V (Evaluation Results), p.1516: “We have seven data sets, six models… [benchmarks on clean datasets only]” – no mention of adversarial/evasion testing; Section III.C (Feature Extraction), pp.1512–1513: feature extraction treats raw URL strings only, with no defenses against active manipulations"}
