{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed tiny-Bert Stacking model is treated as a pure black-box: the paper focuses exclusively on detection performance (accuracy, recall, F1, FPR) and model selection without any mechanism for per-decision or global explanation. There is no discussion of inherently interpretable decision paths, feature importances, or post hoc XAI (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention/gradient‐based heatmaps).","evidence":"Entire paper (Sections III–IV): no mention of interpretability or explanatory analysis; only performance metrics (accuracy, recall, F1, FPR) are provided (e.g., Section IV.A.2, p. 2240)"}
