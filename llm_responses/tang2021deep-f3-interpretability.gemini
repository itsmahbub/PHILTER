    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a deep learning framework with RNN-GRU as the best-performing model. This model is inherently a black box. The feature engineering process involves converting a URL string into a 200x100 matrix based on a character dictionary, which is not directly human-interpretable. The paper makes no mention of employing any post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like LIME, SHAP, or attention mechanisms to provide per-decision explanations. The entire evaluation framework is based on quantitative performance metrics (accuracy, F1, error rates), with no discussion or provision for understanding the reasoning behind the model's classifications.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III.B.3, 'FEATURE EXTRACTION': 'In deep learning models, the tokenization process parses a URL string to a list of characters (Character-level tokens)... we set the maximum number of URL characters to 200. Therefore, each URL can be transformed into a 200*100 matrix.'\nPage 5, Section III.B, 'MACHINE LEARNING': 'This research developed six machine learning models, namely Logistic Regression, Support vector machines (SVM), Random Forest, RNN, RNN-GRU, and RNN-Long short-term memory (LSTM).'\nThe paper's focus is on the RNN-GRU model, a complex, non-transparent architecture. There is no subsequent mention of any method to interpret its predictions throughout the paper."
