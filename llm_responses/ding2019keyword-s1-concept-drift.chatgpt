{"value":"Low","why":"The SHLR method is developed and evaluated using static datasets and standard k-fold cross-validation without any training-on-earlier and testing-on-later temporal split or continual learning component. It relies heavily on volatile lexical and HTML features and does not employ inherently drift-resilient signals or time-aware retraining protocols, thus assuming phishing tactics remain static.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (page 12): “The experiment … uses four datasets: the PhishTank blacklist … Yahoo datasets … URLBlacklist … and DMOZ …” – no temporal separation is used. Section 4.2.3 (page 14): “We perform ten 10-fold cross-validations to assess the effects of different classifiers.” No time-forward or period-based evaluation is described."}
