{"value":"High","why":"Although the paper’s primary benign dataset uses only high-reputation (Alexa Top) domains, the authors explicitly supplement this with a large-scale, ‘in the wild’ evaluation on CertStream domains—which are newly registered (low-reputation) sites—and then drill into the subset of ‘plausible websites’ that legitimately embed major brand logos (e.g., for SSO or advertising). This two-fold analysis demonstrates that Phishpedia maintains low false positives on both long-tail, low-reputation pages and on benign pages with genuine brand elements.","evidence":"Page 12, Sec. 6.1: “We use CertStream service [2] which contains new domains registered from Certificate Transparency Log Network… to retrieve emerging new domains.”\n\nPage 14, Sec. 6.4.2: “Benign websites with logos of big company… We refer to them as plausible websites… Such logos appear for the purposes of advertisement or Single Sign-On (SSO)…”\n\nPage 15: “We additionally collected 131,975 URLs from CertStream… we found 47 (0.036%) such webpages, and our manual validation confirms that four of them are real phishing webpages.”"}
