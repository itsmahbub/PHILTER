{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed hybrid framework is evaluated only via simulated bypasses of individual base models—showing minor performance degradation—but is not tested against a wider range of active evasion techniques (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, dynamic content loading or generated adversarial examples). Thus it demonstrates partial robustness within its input modality but not across the full attack surface.","evidence":"Section 5.2.4 (Experiment 4: robustness): “we simulate a bypass of one of the individual models… The average decrease in F1 score is 3.40%,” showing only a single form of bypass simulation rather than diverse active attacks."}
