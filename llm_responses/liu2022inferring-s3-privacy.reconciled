  "why": "PhishIntention’s detection is performed entirely within the researchers’ own server infrastructure by crawling publicly-available URLs (sourced from CertStream) and analyzing only those fetched pages. It does not rely on or require any data (URLs, screenshots, page content) from end users’ devices, so no sensitive user data is ever transmitted off of a user’s device or third-party network boundary.",
  "evidence": "Page 13, Section 10.1.1: “We choose CertStream [1] for feeding the webpage crawling system. CertStream is a free online service which provides… URLs issued with new certificates. We then feed those URLs (along with their screenshot and HTML code) to various phishing solutions…”\n\nPage 14, Section 10.1.3: “Our crawler keeps crawling the URLs fed from CertStream as a ‘producer’… The URL, its HTML code and its screenshot are stored in a database node. Each phishing solution is deployed in a separate node as a ‘consumer’ to predict on the webpages.”"
