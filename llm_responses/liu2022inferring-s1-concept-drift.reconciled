{"value":"High","why":"PhishIntention addresses concept drift in two ways. First, by design it avoids brittle, drift‐prone signals (e.g. HTML structure or URL heuristics) and instead relies on stable, high‐level visual and dynamic features—logo recognition on screenshots, abstract webpage layouts, and emulated user interactions—to infer both brand and credential‐taking intentions (see Section 4.3). Second, it is evaluated in a true time‐forward deployment: a two‐month field study using CertStream’s real‐time feed of newly issued HTTPS certificates, ensuring that test webpages are chronologically newer and unseen during model development (see Section 10.1). Together, these satisfy the “High” criteria of (1) stable/adaptive feature design and (2) testing on temporally distinct data.","evidence":"• Section 4.3 (CRP Classification): “We design a vision‐based CRP classifier… independent of HTML code implementation.”\n• Section 10.1.1–10.1.2 (Field Study): “We choose CertStream… provides real-time feeds of URLs… The discovery experiment is carried out for two months starting from April 2021, feeding newly registered websites into the pre-trained system.”"}
