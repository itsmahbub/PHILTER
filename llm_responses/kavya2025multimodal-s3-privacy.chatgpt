{"value":"High","why":"The proposed framework incorporates Federated Graph Contrastive Learning (FGCL-Net), an explicit privacy-preserving mechanism where only model updates (e.g., gradients or embeddings) are exchanged and no raw URLs, webpage content, or screenshots leave the client. This meets the “High” criterion by avoiding sensitive data transmission off-device and employing federated learning.","evidence":"Section III (Federated Graph Contrastive Learning Network): “Federated learning aggregates local updates to form a global model without accessing raw data samples.” Additionally, Abstract: “FGCL-Net ensures privacy-preserving learning across decentralized datasets through federated contrastive learning… while safeguarding data privacy.”"}
