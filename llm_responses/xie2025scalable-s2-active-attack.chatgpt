{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not evaluate the robustness of SPWDM against any active evasion or adversarial attacks within its claimed input modalities. All experiments benchmark the model on clean phishing vs. benign examples (including their Crawling2024 dataset and other public datasets) without injecting junk HTML, obfuscated scripts, deferred execution, cloaking, or adversarial perturbations. No adversarial or dynamic-evasion tests are reported.","evidence":"Section 5 (Experiments and analysis) presents only accuracy, precision, recall and F1 on standard datasets and Crawling2024, with no experiments on manipulated or evasively crafted inputs. There is no section evaluating active attacks such as obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, deferred execution or cloaking."}
