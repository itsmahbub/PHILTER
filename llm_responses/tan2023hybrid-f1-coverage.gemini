    "why": "The paper proposes an identity-based detection method that is, by its nature, agnostic to many phishing tactics. The core mechanism involves comparing the brand identity portrayed in the webpage's content (logo, keywords) against the identity of the URL's domain. This design makes it inherently robust to tactics like URL obfuscation (subdomain spoofing, lexical manipulations), HTTPS misuse, and hosting on compromised or shared domains, as a mismatch between the claimed brand and the hosting domain would be detected. Furthermore, the authors explicitly address tactic diversity concerning brand popularity by creating and evaluating their method on two distinct datasets of legitimate websites: high-rank (top 1000) and low-rank (top 5000-6000) sites. This demonstrates a clear consideration for how the method performs against impersonation of less popular brands. However, the evaluation does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the phishing dataset by specific tactics (e.g., percentage using redirection, compromised domains, etc.), nor does it report detection performance for each tactic. Therefore, it meets the criteria for 'Medium' by addressing multiple tactics without a per-tactic breakdown.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 4.1, Dataset preparation: \"In short, we constructed the first dataset (DS-1) consisting of 500 phishing samples, and another 500 legitimate samples sourced from the top 1000 rank of the Alexa top websites list. The second dataset (DS-2) consists of 250 legitimate webpages ranked in between the top 5000 to 6000 of the Alexa top websites list.\"\nPage 12, Section 4.3, Evaluation I: \"Comparing the true negative rates between high-ranked legitimate websites (DS-1) and the low-ranked ones (DS-2), a difference of 3.8% can be observed. This discrepancy seems to support the findings in earlier studies claiming that the authenticities of low-ranked legitimate websites are more difficult to verify. Low-ranked or unpopular legitimate websites often lack strong, easily identifiable, and discriminative identity indicators such as the brand logo.\"\nPage 2, Section 1, Introduction: \"Identity-based phishing detection techniques ascertain whether the portrayed identity (e.g., brand name, logo) presented in the webpage content corresponds to the actual page identity observed through the URL (Jain & Gupta, 2021).\""
