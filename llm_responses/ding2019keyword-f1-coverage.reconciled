{"value":"High","why":"The SHLR method explicitly targets a wide array of URL‐based phishing tactics and reports both how frequently each tactic occurs in the evaluation dataset and how well each corresponding heuristic rule detects its tactic. This satisfies the “High” criteria by (1) providing a quantitative breakdown of tactics in the PhishTank dataset (Table 2) and (2) reporting detection counts for each individual rule/tactic (Table 9).","evidence":"Table 2 (p. 8): “URL exception information statistics” gives percentages for multiple identification names, hidden phishing words, naming‐standard violations, and IP‐as‐domain tactics in the PhishTank dataset. \nTable 9 (p. 14): “The effect of heuristic rule‐based detection phase” lists the number of URLs detected by each of Rules 1–7, directly linking rule performance to each tactic."}
