    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation includes a diverse set of benign webpages that satisfies both criteria for a 'High' rating. \n1) It incorporates low-reputation and long-tail domains through its 'Wild-study Dataset'. This dataset is constructed by crawling 99,000 random fresh websites from CertStream, which are sites that have newly issued or updated TLS certificates. This goes beyond typical high-reputation datasets (like top Alexa sites, which they also use) and provides a more realistic and challenging benign set. \n2) The evaluation accounts for legitimate brand element usage. The appendix explicitly discusses and provides an example of a false positive occurring on a benign news website where an embedded advertisement's logo was misidentified as the primary brand of the page. This demonstrates that their evaluation encountered and analyzed this specific type of challenging benign page.",
    "evidence": "For low-reputation domains: Page 9, Section 4.2, \"Wild-study Dataset. We collect fresh websites from Cert-Stream [4], which provides us with websites that have newly issued or updated TLS certificates. We crawl 3,000 random fresh websites from CertStream every day. Our wild-study was conducted over 33 days, resulting in a dataset of 99,000 webpages.\"\n\nFor legitimate brand element usage: Page 19, Appendix A.3, \"A.3 More Experimental Examples. We show some of the false positive cases found on our experimental 6309 benign websites. The major reason is that the logo detector in current reference-based solutions may report irrelevant logo as the identity logo (See Figure 18).\" The caption for Figure 18 states: \"A FP benign website: https://www.ammonnews.net/contact-us. The logo inside the embedded advertisement is matched to the 'Windsor Brokers' brand.\""
