{"value":"Medium","why":"The evaluation explicitly excludes high-traffic, well-known domains (e.g. citibank.com, cnn.com) from its benign set and instead tests on URLs drawn from Gmail spam and user reports, which necessarily include low-reputation and long-tail domains. However, the paper does not describe any targeted inclusion or analysis of benign pages that legitimately embed third-party brand elements (e.g. PayPal/OAuth widgets or social media logos). Thus only one of the two diversity criteria is fulfilled.","evidence":"Section 3.2.2 (Page 4): “we match a whitelist of 2778 high-profile, safe sites… Sites on this list include citibank.com and cnn.com.”\nSection 4.1 (Page 8): “the only URLs analyzed are… submitted as a potential phishing page or collected from a spam email… URL feature extraction filters out approximately half of the pages as either invalid or whitelisted… The remaining pages… are already quite suspect. However, most of these pages are not phishing.”"}
