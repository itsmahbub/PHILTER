{"value":"High","why":"DynaPhish exposes a clear, per-decision reasoning path for every classification. It builds on reference-based detectors that flag ‘domain-brand inconsistency’ and returns that as an explanation, and for brandless pages it performs counterfactual interactions and reports the specific invariant violated (e.g. “cannot verify fake user credential” or “detecting evasion from original domain”).","evidence":"Page 2, Introduction: “an alarm is reported with the brand-domain inconsistency as the explanation.”; Page 8, Section 3.3.1 (Algorithm 3), lines 13–16: return statements “return {phishing, ‘detecting evasion from original domain’};” and “return {phishing, ‘cannot verify fake user credential’};.”"}
