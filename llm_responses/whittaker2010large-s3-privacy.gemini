    "why": "The paper describes the server-side machine learning system that automatically populates Google's phishing blacklist. The actual detection mechanism deployed to protect end-users relies on this blacklist, which is accessed through a public API used by major browsers. The paper explicitly states that clients like Firefox, Chrome, and Safari use this blacklist. This architecture corresponds to the Google Safe Browsing model, which is a well-established privacy-preserving system. In this model, clients (browsers) check URLs against the blacklist using hashed prefixes, ensuring that the full, potentially sensitive URL is never transmitted to the server for real-time inference. While the server-side classifier processes full URLs, these are sourced from user reports and aggregated spam emails, not from passively monitoring user browsing. The system even employs privacy safeguards during data collection from spam. Therefore, the end-user-facing detection process is explicitly privacy-preserving.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Section 1: 'To help combat phishing, Google publishes a blacklist of phishing URLs and phishing URL patterns [7], [29]. The anti-phishing features in Firefox 3, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari use this blacklist. We provide access to the list to other clients through our public API [18].'\n\nPage 4, Section 3.2.1: 'We receive new potential phishing URLs in reports from users of our blacklist and from spam messages collected by Gmail... For URLs from spam emails, we take precautions to make sure that we do not accidentally fetch user-identifiable URLs. Primarily, we ensure that several unique Gmail users received a URL before we add that URL to our system.'"
