    "why": "The paper explicitly designs and describes a system intended for local, on-device deployment, which is a strong privacy-preserving approach. The authors repeatedly emphasize that the resulting model is small, fast, and optimized for execution on mobile devices with limited resources. The sequence diagram in Figure 7 clearly separates the inference (URL checking) from the training process. During inference, the user's URL is processed by a local 'CNN phishing detector', and no sensitive data is transmitted to an external server for analysis. The model updates happen in a separate, periodic background process that does not involve user-specific URLs.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Figure 7: The sequence diagram illustrates that the 'User' sends a 'URL request' to the 'CNN phishing detector', which processes it and returns a decision. This loop is self-contained. The communication with external APIs ('Phish Tank API & Common Crawl') is for a separate, periodic 'every day' loop to update the CNN model, not for real-time inference on a user's URL.\n\nPage 2, Section 1: 'The trained system is small and fast and can be used effortlessly on mobile devices.'\n\nPage 5, Section 4.3: 'We want to optimize the architecture presented by us so that the network can be implemented in mobile devices with limited memory and computing power.'\n\nPage 7, Section 6: 'The trained phishing detector is small and fast and can be used effortlessly on mobile devices. The training lasts about three minutes and the URL checking about two milliseconds.'"
