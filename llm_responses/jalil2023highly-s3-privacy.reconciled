{"value":"Low","why":"Although the method uses only lexical URL features and no third-party lookups, the paper never describes how inference is deployed or how URLs are handled at detection time (e.g. client-side vs. server). Under the codebook, absence of any inference-time data-handling details mandates a “Low” rating.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 3 (Methodology): “The main focus of this paper is to detect phishing URLs instantly by using only URL characteristics. This can be done by using the URL string only, without visiting the website.”\nPage 11, Section 3.5 (Experimental and implementation setup): “The experiments are conducted … Python script has been developed for data preprocessing and extraction of features while WEKA tool is used for experimentation.”\nNo sections describe client-side inference, containment of URL data on device, or any deployment architecture that prevents URL transmission off-device."}
