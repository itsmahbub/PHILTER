{"value":"Medium","why":"The authors evaluate robustness of VisualPhishNet against a subset of active evasion attacks relevant to screenshot inputs (hand-crafted pixel perturbations such as blurring, noise, occlusion and shifting, and white-box adversarial FGSM perturbations) but do not assess other active evasions in this modality (e.g. dynamic content loading, cloaking, or obfuscated HTML/JS).","evidence":"Page 9, Section 6.7: “Performance against hand-crafted perturbations. We studied 7 types of perturbations… Adversarial perturbations. …we propose and investigate an adaptation of the adversarial example generation methods…”"}
