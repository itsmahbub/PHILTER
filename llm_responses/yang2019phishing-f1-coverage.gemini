    "why": "The proposed method, MFPD, addresses multiple phishing tactics through its two-stage design. The first stage uses a CNN-LSTM on the raw URL string, which can learn patterns indicative of various lexical and structural obfuscation tactics without being explicitly programmed for them. The second stage explicitly engineers a wide range of features that target different tactics. These include URL statistical features like the presence of an 'IP address', 'HTTPS protocol', 'Containing the \"@\"', and 'Edit distance outlier' to detect impersonation. It also uses external signals like 'Registration time' and 'Alexa ranking' to assess domain reputation, a common indicator of phishing. Furthermore, it analyzes webpage code and text to handle content-based mimicry. Despite this broad feature set, the evaluation does not meet the criteria for a 'High' rating. The paper uses a large dataset from PhishTank but does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the phishing samples by the tactics employed (e.g., subdomain spoofing, IP-based, etc.). Consequently, the performance is reported only in aggregate, with no analysis of the model's effectiveness against specific, distinct phishing strategies.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Table 2, 'URL and webpage code features': The table lists numerous features designed to capture a variety of phishing tactics. For example: 'URL statistical features' include 'IP address', 'HTTPS protocol', 'Containing the \"@\"', 'Number of special characters', 'Information entropy', 'Kullback-Leibler divergence', 'Edit distance outlier', 'Registration time', and 'Alexa ranking'. 'Webpage code features' include analysis of 'iframe', 'script', 'pop', and 'eval'. This demonstrates that the method considers multiple tactics.\nPage 9, Section V-A, 'EXPERIMENT DATA AND INDICATORS': This section describes the dataset construction. 'The data used in this experiment are real-life data collected from the Internet. First, historical data confirmed as phishing from 2014 to 2018 were crawled from the PhishTank website, and a total of 1 021 758 URLs were used as positive samples of the phishing.' While the source (PhishTank) is diverse, the paper provides no categorization of these samples by tactic, nor does it report performance on a per-tactic basis in the subsequent evaluation sections."
