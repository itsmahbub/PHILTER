{"value":"Medium","why":"The authors explicitly evaluate concept drift by training models on older data (e.g., March–April 2016) and testing on newer samples (2017 and 2020), demonstrating performance degradation over time. However, they do not propose or implement any adaptive strategies (e.g., continual learning or periodic retraining) nor rely on specialized drift-robust features to mitigate this effect.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “we use datasets from different years to show how models decrease their accuracy over time by training a base model with old datasets and testing it with recent URLs.”; Page 3 (Contribution 4): “We trained the model on a dataset collected between March 2016 and April 2016, and we evaluated the model on other datasets collected between 2017 and 2020.”"}
