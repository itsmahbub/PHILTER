{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s phishing detection evaluation measures false positives only on 6,075 benign sites drawn from Alexa ranks 5,000–15,000 (high-reputation domains). It does not include any low-reputation/long-tail domains or benign pages embedding legitimate brand elements, and thus fails to test the harder benign subsets required for a ‘High’ or ‘Medium’ rating.","evidence":"Section 4.1.3 Datasets (page 528): “We collected a comparable number of benign websites (6,075) by crawling from the Alexa Top 5,000 to 15,000 websites.”"}
