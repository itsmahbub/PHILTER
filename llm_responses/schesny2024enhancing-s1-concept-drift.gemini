    "why": "The proposed method relies on querying a pre-trained LLM (ChatGPT) with engineered prompts. It does not incorporate any adaptive strategies like continual learning or periodic retraining to address the evolution of phishing tactics (concept drift). The underlying LLM is treated as a static, black-box detector. The evaluation protocol reinforces this assessment, as it is conducted on a small, fixed set of 11 websites drawn from a previous study. There is no temporal separation in the data; the experiment does not involve training on older data and testing on newer data to measure the method's resilience to evolving threats. The paper assumes that the phishing characteristics detectable by its prompts remain static.",
