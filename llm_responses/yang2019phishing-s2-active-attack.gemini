    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation is performed on a static dataset of known phishing (PhishTank) and legitimate (dmoztools.net) URLs. While the proposed method extracts features from URLs, webpage code (HTML/JavaScript), and text, there is no evidence of it being tested against active attacks or evasive maneuvers. The evaluation does not include experiments with obfuscated code (e.g., hidden 'eval' functions), cloaking (serving different content to the detector), dynamically loaded content, or adversarial examples crafted to mislead the classifiers. The methodology is limited to classifying pre-existing, non-manipulated samples, which directly aligns with the 'Low' criteria of evaluating on 'clean phishing vs. benign examples without adversarial or evasive manipulation'.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section V-A, \"EXPERIMENT DATA AND INDICATORS\": \"The data used in this experiment are real-life data collected from the Internet. First, historical data confirmed as phishing from 2014 to 2018 were crawled from the PhishTank website, and a total of 1 021 758 URLs were used as positive samples of the phishing. Then, 989 021 URLs were crawled from the open catalogue website dmoztools.net [38] as negative samples of the phishing website, which are legitimate URLs.\" This quote describes the dataset's origin, confirming it is a collection of existing examples rather than a set designed to test for active evasions. The entire evaluation section (V) focuses on performance metrics on this static data, with no mention of robustness against attacks."
