{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed PhishingRTDS method uses a static dataset randomly split into training, validation, and test sets without any temporal separation or concept‐drift handling mechanisms. There is no periodic retraining, continual learning, time‐aware feature engineering, or evaluation on data from different time periods to assess robustness to evolving attacker tactics.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 4.1 (“Finally, we split the dataset randomly into a 60% training set, 20% test set, and 12% validation set.”) and Section 4.5 (evaluation solely on this static split). No mention of temporal or continual evaluation."}
