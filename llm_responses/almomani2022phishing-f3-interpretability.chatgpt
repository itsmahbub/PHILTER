{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method relies solely on black‐box machine learning classifiers (e.g., RandomForest, SVM, GradientBoosting) and reports only overall accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics. It does not provide any per‐decision explanations (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention maps), expose decision paths of tree models, or present global feature importances to aid interpretability.","evidence":"Page 12–14, Section 4 (Results and Discussion): only accuracy, precision, recall and AUC for 16 classifiers are reported (e.g., Table 4, Table 6); no mention of explanation or interpretability methods throughout the paper."}
