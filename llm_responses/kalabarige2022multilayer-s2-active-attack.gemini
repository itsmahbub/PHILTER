    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a multilayer stacked ensemble learning model and evaluates it on four standard, static, feature-based datasets (UCI and Mendeley). The evaluation is limited to measuring classification performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F-score) on these datasets. There is no experiment, analysis, or discussion regarding the model's resilience to active attacks. The methodology does not involve testing against manipulated inputs, obfuscated content, adversarial examples, or any other form of evasion technique relevant to its input modality. The benchmarks are limited to clean phishing vs. benign examples as provided by the static datasets.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III-A, DATASET: \"The proposed work applied on four datasets named as D1, D2, D3, D4. D1 is collected from UCI repository [17] and D2 is collected from mendely [20] with 48 features. Finally, D3 and D4 are also collected from mendely [30] where the dataset D3 contains 111 features with 58,645 instances, D4 contains with 111 features with 88,647 instances.\"\n\nPage 6, Section IV, EXPERIMENTATION RESULTS: \"The classification metrics such as Precision, Recall, F-score and Accuracy are considered to evaluate its performance.\"\n\nPage 8, Section IV-B, THE COMPARISON OF MLSELM WITH EXISTING LITERATURE: \"In this section, we compare our proposed model with existing works. As we tested our model on various datasets, we compare our work with the existing works that used same datasets.\"\n\nThese sections demonstrate that the entire evaluation is based on performance on pre-existing, static datasets, without any form of adversarial or evasive manipulation."
