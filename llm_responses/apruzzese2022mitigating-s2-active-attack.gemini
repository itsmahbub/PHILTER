    "why": "The paper's entire premise is to design and evaluate a defense against active adversarial attacks. It introduces a novel defense mechanism, Protective Operation Chain (POC), specifically to mitigate \"Gray-Box\" attacks where an adversary has partial knowledge of the detector's features. The authors define and test against a diverse set of active attacks within the system's modality (feature-based detection from URL, HTML, and DNS). These attacks include both simple, targeted feature manipulations (e.g., URL shortening, HTML link injection) and a more sophisticated, generalized model of feature perturbation (GBA-Δ) where an attacker can modify a variable percentage of the known features. The experimental evaluation is extensive, demonstrating across 13 classifiers and 4 datasets that the POC method significantly increases resilience to these attacks compared to baseline detectors.",
    "evidence": "1. **Page 4, Section 4.1, Simple Attacks**: The paper explicitly defines active attacks targeting common phishing detection features. \"GBA-1: The attacker assumes that the PD uses information about the length of the URL to predict whether it belongs to a phishing website or not... Thus, an attacker may try to evade detection by devising phishing URLs with shorter URLs: a possible way to accomplish this is by using a URL shortening service (e.g., tinyurl.com). GBA-2: Here, the attacker assumes that the PD uses features related to the HTML-code ... he tries to alter some aspects of his HTML code. For example, he might know that some PDs consider the ratio of internal links ... to external links. Hence, in this attack, he inserts a number of “internal” links to his URL domain that might fool classifiers that use this feature.\"\n2. **Page 5, Section 4.2, Complex Attacks**: The paper introduces a generalized adversarial model where the attacker can manipulate a subset of known features. \"In our more sophisticated attacks GBA-Δ, the adversary knows a variable subset of the features used by the defender... This family of attacks is based on Δ, the percentage of features actually used by the defender that the attacker guessed correctly... The 27 basic features used (cf. Table 2) can be easily manipulated by experts who can easily insert/remove redirections, synthetically modify the URL length, or change any HTML functionality of the webpage to alter the features shown in Table 2.\"\n3. **Page 12, Section 7.1.3, Protection of POC**: The paper's conclusion from the statistical analysis confirms the method's effectiveness against the defined attacks. \"Our experiments suggest that hardening classifiers with POC yields results that are superior to those of their baseline variants... The results confirm that using POC yields more resilient classifiers against the Gray Box attacks considered in this paper.\""
