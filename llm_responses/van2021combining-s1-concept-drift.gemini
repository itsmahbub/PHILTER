    "why": "The method is designed to be resilient to concept drift by focusing on features that are inherently more stable over time: visual identity elements like logos. By extracting features from a rendered screenshot, it aims to be robust against evolving evasion techniques in the source code (e.g., image splitting, CSS-based images). Furthermore, it leverages third-party search engines for target identification, which are themselves highly adaptive systems, thus offloading the need for a static, local database of benign sites. This design choice inherently avoids many volatile features. However, the evaluation protocol does not explicitly test for this resilience. The dataset was collected over a narrow four-month window and partitioned using a standard 70/30 split for training/validation, not a chronological split (e.g., training on older data, testing on newer data). Therefore, while the design is drift-aware, the evaluation does not provide empirical evidence of its long-term performance.",
    "evidence": "Design Resilience (Stable Features): Page 4, Section 3.1, \"By relying on a screenshot of the web page (rather than relying only on features extracted from the web page), our approach is robust against resource evasion techniques, such as image splitting (Fig. 2) or the replacement of image resources by pure CSS.\"\nDesign Resilience (Adaptive Component): Page 4, Section 3.1, \"Relying on a search engine to find the associated pages guarantees the language independence of the approach and zero-day protection as well as it avoids the need of maintaining an updated list of all possible benign websites.\"\nLack of Temporal Evaluation: Page 6, Section 4.2.1, \"The set of phishing web pages originate from 100,000 URLs that were posted in phishing feeds such as Open-Phish [25], PhishTank [30], and PhishStats [29] between September 2019 and December 2019.\" and Page 7, Section 4.3, \"Of the 2,000 websites (1,000 legitimate and 1,000 phishing), we used 70% for training and optimal filter parameters setup and the remaining 30% to validate the results.\""
