    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a deep learning model that takes a full URL as input for classification. However, it completely omits any discussion of the deployment architecture or inference-time data handling. There is no mention of whether the detection runs on the client-side (e.g., in a browser), within a secure organizational boundary (e.g., a gateway), or on an external server. The paper also fails to describe any privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as URL hashing, sanitization of parameters, or federated learning. The model is described as taking a URL string and outputting a verdict, but the real-world data flow from a user to the model is not addressed. As per the codebook, a 'Low' rating is assigned when 'no inference-time data-handling details are given' and 'no privacy safeguards are described', as this implies a default scenario where full, potentially sensitive URLs are sent to an external server for analysis.",
    "evidence": "1. Page 1, Abstract: \"If we treat a URL as a text string, this mechanism can learn comprehensive URL representations... Finally, the trained classifier can give a high-accuracy result for an unknown website URL.\" - This establishes that the input is a raw URL string, which can contain private information, but does not specify where the classification of an 'unknown URL' occurs.\n2. Page 5, Section 4.1: \"As we know, a URL or a website address is formed with 84 kinds of characters (a-z, A-Z, 0–9, -.!*'();:&=+$,/?#[]) (Lin et al., 2017). Hence, we can leverage one-hot encoding... to transform a character in the URL into a 84-dimension vector.\" - This confirms the model processes the full character set of a URL, without mention of sanitization or hashing.\n3. Page 6, Section 4.1: \"In the detection phase, the real unknown URLs feed into self-attention CNN to get the labels.\" - This describes the inference process abstractly, without specifying the physical or logical location of the model relative to the user, and thus fails to provide any details on data handling or transmission.\n4. Page 11, Section 5.3: The paper discusses 'detection time' in microseconds, stating \"our method can detect 5,747 URL samples per second.\" While this analyzes performance, it does so in a batch processing context typical of experiments, not in a deployment context that would address privacy implications of processing user data."
