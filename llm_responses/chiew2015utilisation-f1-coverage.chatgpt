{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed logo-based detection method does not address the range of phishing tactics (e.g., URL obfuscation, homograph attacks, shared-hosting, IP-based URLs) and its evaluation uses a generic PhishTank dataset without any breakdown by tactic. There is no discussion of tactic-agnostic design nor performance reported per phishing tactic.","evidence":"Page 6 (Section 3.3 Experimental results): “Dataset 2 contains 500 phishing and 500 legitimate webpages.” No information is provided on the diversity of phishing tactics in the dataset or per-tactic detection performance."}
