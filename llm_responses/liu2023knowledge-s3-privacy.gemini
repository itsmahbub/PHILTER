    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method, DynaPhish, relies heavily on external, third-party services for its core 'Brand Knowledge Expansion' module. This process involves sending sensitive information derived from the user's visited webpage to these external services without any mentioned privacy-preserving mechanisms. Specifically, the method sends logos (image content from the webpage) to Google's logo detection service for brand identification, and it sends the webpage's domain and title to a search engine to validate popularity. This constitutes the transmission of webpage content and metadata to an external server for inference, which directly aligns with the criteria for a 'Low' rating. The paper does not describe any privacy safeguards like hashing, anonymization, or on-premise deployment for these critical functions.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.2.3: 'To achieve this, we adopt Google's logo detection service [9] to predict the brand name given a logo. Our investigation shows that the service is well capable of detecting the brand names for both text-based logos and non-text-based logos. Subsequently, Google search engine recommends the relevant webpages given the detected brand name.'\n\nPage 5, Section 3.2.1 & Algorithm 1: 'We define the webpage w as popular if the following criteria are met: • C1: w is indexed by the state-of-the-art search engine (e.g., Google), • C2: w ranks high in the recommendation when its description is fed to search engine...'. This is implemented in Algorithm 1, line 4: 'W = search_engine.search(domain.tld, page_title, k);', which explicitly sends the domain and page title to an external service."
