{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed method employs URL-based features (e.g. IP address, HTTPS misuse, subdomain/TLD manipulations, Levenshtein‐based brand impersonation) and HTML‐based features, thus addressing multiple phishing tactics in its design. However, the evaluation reports only overall accuracy, missing‐alarm and false‐alarm rates on the datasets without any quantitative breakdown of performance by tactic category.","evidence":"Page 3, Section 3.1.1: “IP address … HTTPS … Number of dots in domain … Similar target brands …” (covers multiple tactics); Page 8, Table 3 and Section 4: only overall metrics (accuracy, missing rate, false alarm rate) are reported, with no per‐tactic performance breakdown."}
