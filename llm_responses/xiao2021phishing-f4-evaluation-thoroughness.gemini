    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper reports several essential class-sensitive metrics required for evaluating a classifier in an imbalanced setting, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and False Positive Rate (FPR). The authors demonstrate an understanding of the limitations of accuracy, stating, \"If the dataset is imbalanced...Rec is more important than Acc.\" However, the evaluation does not meet the 'High' criteria because it fails to include any of the specified summary metrics that provide a more holistic view of performance, such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC. The evaluation is therefore comprehensive in its use of class-sensitive metrics but lacks a summary metric to fully capture overall classification quality.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section 5.1, \"Datasets and metrics\": \"We introduce metrics of Accuracy (Acc), FPR, Recall (Rec), Precision (Pre) and F1 score (F1) to evaluate the performance of classifiers. Table 2 gives the definition of TP, TN, FP, FN. Consequently the five metrics can be calculated as follow: ...\" The paper then provides the formulas for Accuracy, FPR, Recall, Precision, and F1-score across equations (9) through (13). These metrics are consistently used in the results tables (e.g., Table 3, Table 6, Table 7)."
