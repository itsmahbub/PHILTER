    "why": "The paper's framework is explicitly designed to address concept drift by modeling the temporal evolution of phishing attacks. Two of its core proposed models, the Temporal Graph Neural Network with Attention (TGNN-Att) and the final Multi-Modal Temporal Hypergraph Fusion Network (MMTHF-Net), are built on the concept of temporal snapshots. These models use attention mechanisms and LSTMs to capture dynamic changes in website structure and content over time. The authors validate this adaptive capability through a rigorous temporal evaluation protocol. They use datasets with historical records (URLNet) to create time-ordered graph snapshots and test their model's performance across different time windows. The results, particularly in Table 4 and Figure 5, demonstrate that their approach maintains high accuracy over time, while baseline methods exhibit a significant performance degradation, confirming the method's effectiveness in adapting to concept drift.",
    "evidence": "page 13, Section IV: \"Table 4 and figure 5 evaluates the temporal adaptability of the TGNN-Att model across 4 timestamp windows within a 24-hour period. The accuracy of TGNN-Att remains consistently above 91.8%, peaking at 93.2% between 6-12 hours... Compared to baseline methods, which exhibit a gradual drop in accuracy as timestamp progresses, TGNN-Att effectively captures temporal changes like URL redirects, IP migrations, and dynamic webpage content using attention-enhanced temporal graph networks.\" This is supported by Table 4, 'Temporal adaptability of Tgnn-Att (Accuracy over time)', which shows the proposed model's accuracy remaining stable (92.7% down to 91.8%) while baseline methods degrade significantly (e.g., Method [3] from 85.4% down to 81.6%) over a 24-hour period."
