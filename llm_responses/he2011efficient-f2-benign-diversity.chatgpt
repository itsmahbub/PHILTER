{"value":"Low","why":"The benign evaluation set is composed almost entirely of high-reputation, popular domains (top-targeted sites and Alexa top sites) and does not include any long-tail/low-reputation domains or benign pages embedding common brand elements (e.g. PayPal/OAuth widgets, social-media buttons). Thus it fails to cover either of the two harder benign subsets required for a robust false-positive assessment.","evidence":"Section 5.1 (page 12024): “We collected 100 login pages of top targeted legitimate websites … 35 Homepages of top targeted websites. 35 Top pages according to Alexa. 30 Random pages from a list of 500 pages used in 3Sharp’s phishing study.”"}
