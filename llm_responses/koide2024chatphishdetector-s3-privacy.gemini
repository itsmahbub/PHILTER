    "why": "The proposed method, ChatPhishDetector, sends sensitive user-related data to external, third-party servers for analysis. The core process involves collecting the full URL, the browser-rendered HTML, text extracted via OCR, and a screenshot of the webpage. This collected data is then embedded into a prompt and sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference. The paper's primary evaluation relies on external services such as Azure OpenAI API and Google Cloud API. This design transmits potentially private information (e.g., URLs with session tokens or identifiers, page content) off the user's device without any mentioned privacy-preserving mechanisms like hashing, data sanitization, or anonymization. While the paper discusses the future potential of running open-source models locally, the evaluated high-performance system architecture fundamentally compromises user privacy by design.",
    "evidence": "page 4, Section III-B, Prompt Template 1: The prompt template explicitly shows the inclusion of raw data sent to the LLM: \"URL: {URL} HTML: {Browser-rendered HTML} Text extracted using OCR: {OCR-extracted text}\". In Vision mode, it also notes the inclusion of a \"screenshot image\".\n\npage 7, Section V-A, 1) MODELS: The paper states its reliance on external cloud services for its primary models: \"We used the Azure OpenAI API [50] for accessing gpt-4-0314 (referred to as GPT-4) and gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 (referred to as GPT-3.5) in normal mode, and gpt-4-vision-preview (referred to as GPT-4V) in vision mode. Gemini Pro is an LLM developed by Google DeepMind [51]. We used Gemini Pro 1.0 in normal mode and vision mode, accessed via the Google Cloud API.\""
