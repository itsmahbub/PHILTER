    "why": "The paper's proposed hybrid framework is designed to address tactic diversity by combining three different analysis modalities: URL, HTML content, and HTML DOM tree structure. The authors' rationale is that this multi-faceted approach makes the system inherently more robust and harder for attackers to evade, as a bypass of one model (e.g., via URL manipulation) could still be caught by another (e.g., via HTML content analysis). This design is tactic-agnostic as it relies on deep learning models to learn malicious patterns from raw data rather than using heuristics for specific, known tactics. However, the paper's evaluation does not explicitly validate this capability. The evaluation dataset is described in terms of its sources (PhishTank, OpenPhish) but is not broken down by the specific phishing tactics employed (e.g., homographs, subdomain spoofing, HTTPS misuse). Consequently, the experimental results report on overall detection performance and a simulated bypass scenario, but do not provide a per-tactic performance breakdown.",
    "evidence": "page 5, Section 3.2, \"First, this approach leverages the strengths and mitigates the weaknesses of different detection algorithms, enhancing overall capabilities and making it harder for attackers to evade detection. Secondly, it enables comprehensive website analysis by distributing the evaluation of diverse website features among individual models, thereby improving accuracy.\"\npage 7, Section 4.2, \"As we do not use visual features of a website as an input, there remain three other types of features for the proof of concept to analyze: the URL, HTML content, and HTML DOM tree structure. The URL and HTML content have shown to be effective in previous research (Valiyaveedu et al. 2021). The HTML DOM tree is a less explored topic. Nevertheless, it widens the information analyzable by the proof of concept.\"\npage 9, Section 5.1, \"The phishing websites come from PhishTank (PhishTank 2022), OpenPhish (OpenPhish 2022) and PhishRepo (Ariyadasa et al. 2022).\" (Note: This section describes the data sources but provides no analysis of the tactics present in the dataset.)"
