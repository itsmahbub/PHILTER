    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed system, DEPHIDES, utilizes deep learning models (ANN, CNN, RNN, etc.) that are inherently black-box. Although one of the tested models is an Attention Network (ATT), which has the potential to provide per-decision explanations, the authors do not leverage or demonstrate this capability. The paper's evaluation focuses exclusively on quantitative performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and processing speed. There are no mentions or applications of post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM) to interpret the decisions of their chosen CNN model. The paper acknowledges interpretability in the related work section when discussing another study, but does not incorporate any such mechanism into its own proposed method, making it a pure black box that provides a classification without reasoning.",
    "evidence": "page 5, Section D: \"A phishing URL detection system based on the RNN architecture was developed in [27]... The feature that distinguishes this study from others is its ability to visualize the effects of the URL sections on the outcome. Thanks to the visualization they've developed, which fields in the URL cause phishing characters can be understood by the human eye.\" - This quote shows the authors are aware of interpretability but only mention it in the context of prior work, not their own.\n\npage 11, Section C: \"In contrast, Attention Networks (ATTs) employ an approach that prioritizes comprehending the entire context... Attention networks discern critical portions of the data... These networks pinpoint and select the important or distinctive elements of the data.\" - The paper describes the mechanism of attention networks that allows for interpretability but never utilizes this to generate explanations in the results sections.\n\npage 12-17, Sections V, VI, VII: The experimental results, discussion, and conclusion sections focus entirely on performance metrics like accuracy, loss, F-score, and training time. There is no qualitative analysis or visualization explaining why a particular URL was flagged as phishing."
