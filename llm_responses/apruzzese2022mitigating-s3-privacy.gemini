    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's proposed method, Protective Operation Chain (POC), is an algorithmic defense against adversarial attacks that operates by transforming an initial set of features into a new, obfuscated feature space. The evaluation is conducted entirely on static, pre-collected datasets. The paper does not describe a deployment architecture, such as a client-server model or a local/browser-based implementation. There is no discussion of how user data, such as URLs or webpage content, would be handled during real-time inference. Without any mention of client-side processing, data sanitization, or other privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., hashing, federated learning), it must be assumed that the full data required for feature extraction would be sent to an external server for analysis. This lack of detail on inference-time data handling and privacy safeguards places the method in the 'Low' category.",
    "evidence": "The paper details the features used (Table 2, page 4), which include URL, reputation, and HTML features. The core contribution, the POC algorithm (Section 5, page 6), is a method to transform these features. The experimental validation (Section 6, page 8) is performed on four static datasets. The paper makes no mention of a deployment model that would protect user privacy. For instance, it does not specify whether feature extraction and classification happen on the user's device or on a remote server. The claim that 'POC is practical for real deployments' (Section 2, page 2) is substantiated based on performance and robustness, not on privacy considerations. The entire paper lacks any discussion of privacy preservation for users in a live environment."
