    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes PhishBERT, a large-scale deep learning model based on a 12-layer Transformer architecture, pre-trained on over 3 billion URLs. The significant computational and memory requirements of such models typically necessitate a server-side deployment where a client sends data (the URL) to a server for inference. The paper provides no details on the intended deployment architecture for inference. It does not mention any client-side execution, privacy-preserving techniques like URL hashing, federated learning, or feature anonymization. In the absence of any discussion on privacy safeguards or local deployment, the default assumption is that full, raw URLs would be transmitted to an external server for classification. This falls under the 'Low' category, as no inference-time data-handling details or privacy mechanisms are described.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"In this paper, we propose PhishBERT, a veritable pre-trained deep transformer network model for phishing URL detection... PhishBERT obtained a general understanding of various URLs by being pretrained on a corpus of more than 3 billion unlabeled URL data.\"\n\nPage 2, Section 2.1: \"PhishBERT uses the exact same network architecture as BERT [8], i.e., a stack of 12-layer Transformer [11] network encoders.\"\n\nThe paper extensively details the model's architecture (Section 2), training data (Section 3), and performance evaluation (Section 4), but completely omits any discussion of its deployment model, real-world application, or data handling during the inference stage, which is critical for assessing privacy preservation."
