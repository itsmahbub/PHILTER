    "why": "The proposed method demonstrates resilience against a subset of active attacks, particularly those involving visual manipulation, but its evaluation does not cover the full spectrum of relevant threats. The system's design, which relies on rendering the webpage and analyzing the Document Object Model (DOM), inherently bypasses some common obfuscation techniques. The authors specifically identify and design countermeasures for logos embedded within image sprites and logos with transparent backgrounds, which can be considered evasive visual tactics. This is achieved by analyzing the rendered visual elements directly and programmatically manipulating CSS for post-processing. However, the paper does not evaluate or discuss resistance to other significant active attacks applicable to its dynamic analysis modality, such as cloaking (where a server presents benign content to the detector) or deferred execution (where malicious content like a login form is only loaded after user interaction). The evaluation is conducted on standard datasets without evidence of specific adversarial or evasive examples being included to test the system's limits. Therefore, while it shows partial robustness, it does not cover a diverse set of active attacks.",
    "evidence": "1. **Evidence of addressing visual manipulations (Image Sprites):** \"As described in Section 3.1.1, our proposed technique alleviates this problem by manipulating the DOM of a rendered webpage to compute logo image candidates from the visible elements displayed hence the non-related sub-images can be excluded effectively.\" (Page 15, Section 4.8.2)\n2. **Evidence of addressing visual manipulations (Transparent Backgrounds):** \"To overcome this limitation, we employ an active DOM manipulation approach to recolour the background of the selected logo with a solid colour. [...] By manipulating the CSS background-color attribute of the logo’s DOM element, the dominant colour can then be overlaid underneath the logo as a solid colour background, replacing the original noisy background...\" (Page 8, Section 3.1.5)\n3. **Lack of evaluation against other active attacks:** The evaluation is performed on datasets constructed from standard sources (PhishTank, OpenPhish, Alexa list) without mention of including samples known for active evasion. The \"Analysis of misclassified phishing samples\" (Section 4.7) discusses how adversaries \"intentionally alter its content to increase stealthiness and avoid detection,\" but the examples analyzed (e.g., banners of free hosting, imitating non-existent brands) do not include technical evasions like cloaking or deferred execution."
