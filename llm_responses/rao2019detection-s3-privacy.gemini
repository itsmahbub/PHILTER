    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method relies on several third-party services for feature extraction, which inherently leaks information about the user's browsing activity. Specifically, it sends the website's domain name to external WHOIS and Alexa servers to get domain age and page rank. It also queries the Bing search engine with the website's Title, Copyright, or Description to check for its presence in search results. Furthermore, the 'Broken links ratio' feature (HF8) implies making network requests to links found on the webpage to check their status. The paper does not mention any privacy-preserving mechanisms like hashing, truncation, or anonymization for these external queries. This direct transmission of domain names and content identifiers to third-party servers for analysis constitutes a significant privacy risk, aligning with the 'Low' criteria.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 3.1.2, Third-party service-based features:\n- \"TF1-Age of Domain: This feature calculates the age of a website's domain which is extracted from WHOIS database.\"\n- \"TF2-Page Rank: ...To obtain the PageRank score from the Alexa PageRank system, we just send a normal HTTP request to the (http://data.alexa.com/data?cli=10&url=\"+domain) and use XML parser to get the Alexa ranking.\"\n- \"TF3-Website in Search Engine Results: ...This feature queries the search engine with Title or Copyright or Description of a suspicious website and classifies the status of website based on the presence of its domain in top N search results... we considered Bing search engine for the evaluation of this feature.\"\nPage 20, Section 6, Discussion: \"We used Bing Search engine for comparing suspicious domain with top N search results, WHOIS database for calculating the age of domain, Alexa page ranking for identifying the rank of website as third-party service features. These features make our method suffer from network latency due to querying each service.\""
