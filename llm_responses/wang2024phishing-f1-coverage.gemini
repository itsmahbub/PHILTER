    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's visual similarity method is, by design, agnostic to many URL- and HTML-based phishing tactics. The evaluation explicitly addresses several key and diverse tactics by testing for the detection of \"zero-day\" attacks, robustness against \"partially similar phishing pages,\" and resilience to adversarial attacks (salt and pepper noise, FGSM). The authors dedicate specific experiments and datasets to evaluate performance against these threats. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the various phishing tactics (e.g., hosting on compromised domains, subdomain spoofing, etc.) present within its evaluation datasets, nor does it report performance across a wider spectrum of such tactics. It addresses multiple tactics but lacks the per-tactic breakdown required for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "1. Page 1, Section 1: \"Nowadays, attackers have begun to craft partially similar phishing pages to bypass these detection methods... how to detect partially similar phishing pages with a low false positive rate is studied in this paper.\"\n2. Page 5, Section 4.1: \"Zero-day phishing webpage dataset. To evaluate zero-day phishing pages, 955 pages targeting the trusted list were collected from PhishTank.\"\n3. Page 9, Section 4.4: \"In this part, two adversarial attacks are applied to the proposed model to analyze the model's efficacy in defending against adversarial attacks. The salt and pepper noise and the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) (Shlens et al., 2015) are selected to evaluate the model's robustness.\"\n4. Page 10, Section 4.5, Table 12: The paper presents \"Comparison results in the zero-day phishing pages,\" demonstrating a specific evaluation against this tactic."
