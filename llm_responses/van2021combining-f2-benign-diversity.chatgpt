{"value":"Medium","why":"The evaluation includes a diverse set of low-reputation and long-tail domains by sampling 1,000 sites from the DMOZ directory (which contains many small, regional, and less-popular domains), but it does not explicitly include a subset of benign pages featuring legitimate brand elements (e.g., PayPal/OAuth widgets or embedded social media logos).","evidence":"Page 8, Section 4.2.2 Benign dataset: “The main advantage of using the DMOZ database… is that this database contains also less popular web pages. … Therefore, it is important that less known websites are also protected…” (no mention of embedding legitimate brand elements)"}
