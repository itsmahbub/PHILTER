{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any privacy‐preserving deployment or data‐handling mechanism. It relies solely on centrally stored datasets with raw URL– and page‐based features for model training and evaluation, and gives no details on client‐side inference, feature sanitization, or hashing to protect user data.","evidence":"Page 5, Section III.A (“Overall Research Methodology”): “The phishing website dataset contains 11,055 instances, 30 independent features … Address-Bar based features (having 12 of the 30 features).” No privacy safeguards or on-device inference are described."}
