{"value":"Medium","why":"The method explicitly incorporates mechanisms and features to handle multiple phishing tactics—namely client-/server-side cloaking (using WebDriver to simulate human browsing), URL redirection, and cloned-site hyperlinks—demonstrating tactic-agnostic design across these categories. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of its evaluation dataset by tactic nor report per-tactic detection results, aligning with the Medium criterion.","evidence":"– Page 2, Section 1(b): “A module for capturing access information was developed using WebDriver to bypass obfuscation techniques … basic actions that mimic human behavior…” (addresses cloaking)\n– Page 6, Table I: Feature “Whether to redirect technology” and Feature “Number of domain name links that are different from the access domain name” (addresses redirection and cloned sites)\n– Page 13, Table IX and Section 5.4: Overall ACC, PRE, REC, F-1 reported on Crawling2024 with no per-tactic breakdown"}
