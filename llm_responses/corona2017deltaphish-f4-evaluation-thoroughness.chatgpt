{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper’s evaluation reports class-sensitive measures—specifically the true positive rate (recall) and false positive rate—via ROC curves (Fig. 6), but does not report precision, F1-score, or any summary metric such as AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC. Thus it provides some relevant metrics but lacks full coverage required for a high rating.","evidence":"Page 14, Section 4.2: “Fig. 6. ROC curves (left) … Each curve reports the average detection rate of phishing pages (i.e., the true positive rate, TP) against the fraction of misclassified legitimate pages (i.e., the false positive rate, FP).” and “The HTML-based classifier is able to detect more than 97% of phishing webpages while misclassifying less than 0.5% of legitimate webpages.”"}
