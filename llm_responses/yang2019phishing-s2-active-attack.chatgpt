{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates the proposed MFPD method solely on clean, real-world phishing and benign URLs/webpages and reports accuracy and false-positive rates on these unmodified datasets. It does not assess resilience to any active evasions—such as URL obfuscation, injected junk HTML/JavaScript, content cloaking, or adversarial perturbations—within its claimed URL and page-analysis scope. No experiments or analysis address deliberate manipulations intended to bypass the detector.","evidence":"Abstract and Section V.A: “Testing on a dataset containing millions of phishing URLs and legitimate URLs, the accuracy reaches 98.99%...” (p. 1)  Section IV–V: feature extraction and evaluation descriptions involve only static URL character sequences, URL statistics, page code and text counts, with no mention of adversarial or evasion tests."}
