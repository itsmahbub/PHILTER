{"value":"Medium","why":"While DynaPhish is explicitly designed to handle multiple phishing tactics (novel brands, brandless pages, obfuscation), the paper does not provide a quantitative, per-tactic breakdown of detection performance. It reports overall recall improvements and ablation gains, but it does not measure recall or precision separately for each tactic category as required for a “High” rating.","evidence":"Section 2 (Threat Model) defines T1–T3 tactics; Section 6 (RQ2: Ablation Study) and Section 5 report only overall recall/precision improvements without per-tactic performance metrics."}
