{"value":"Medium","why":"The framework is designed to be tactic-agnostic—leveraging multi-modal, temporal, and high-order graph features to capture a wide range of phishing behaviors—but the paper does not provide a quantitative, per-tactic breakdown of performance on specific evasion strategies.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “These approaches together allow for exact, real-time phishing detection by capturing static and temporal behaviors, high-order relationships, and cross-modal features.” \nPage 11 (Section IV): Evaluation across multiple datasets (PhishTank, OpenPhish, URLNet) reporting overall accuracy, F1, precision and recall, with no per-tactic performance reporting."}
