{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method is a black-box CNN embedding and distance framework with no mechanism for per-decision explanations, feature importance, or post hoc interpretability. The paper focuses exclusively on model architecture, embeddings, and performance metrics (precision@k, recall@k) without exposing any decision paths, attention maps, or XAI techniques.","evidence":"Section IV.D (page 3): “We evaluate the performance of our model using the precision@k and recall@k for k = 1 and 6.” (No mention of explainability or interpretability mechanisms throughout the methodology.)"}
