{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed BlackPhish method incorporates multiple phishing‐tactics–agnostic mechanisms (visual‐similarity for near‐duplicate detection, URL‐based features for IP‐address URLs, brand‐in‐subdomain spoofing, lexical manipulations, presence of HTTPS, zero‐link/image‐based attacks, etc.) but the authors do not report detection performance broken down by tactic category.","evidence":"Section 3.2 (URL-based features includes IP address check, brand‐in‐subdomain, digit/hyphen counts, PhishHinted words; zero‐links in SF6 to catch image‐based phishing); Section 3.1 (use of Simhash/PHash for near‐duplicate and screenshot‐based attacks). No per‐tactic performance tables in Section 4 (only overall metrics in Tables 8–13)."}
