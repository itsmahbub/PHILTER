{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed method explicitly includes and evaluates countermeasures against two common visual evasion tactics—logo sprites and transparent-background logos—demonstrating partial robustness within its visual rendering modality. However, the paper does not evaluate other active attacks in scope (e.g. cloaking, deferred execution, adversarial HTML/JavaScript obfuscation). Thus it shows resilience against a subset of active attacks but not a diverse full spectrum.","evidence":"– Section 4.8.2 (Page 15): discusses handling logos embedded in image sprites via DOM manipulation to exclude non-logo sub-images.\n– Section 3.1.5 (Page 8): describes active DOM/CSS rewriting to recolor transparent-background logos for accurate reverse image search.\n– No experiments or discussion on other evasions (e.g., cloaking, deferred execution), with evaluation limited to standard clean datasets (Section 4.1 & 4.3)."}
