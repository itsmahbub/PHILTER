{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s phishing detection method relies solely on static URL and HTML features and evaluates only on clean phishing versus benign datasets without considering or testing any active evasion or adversarial manipulations (e.g. junk HTML, obfuscated scripts, dynamic content loading, cloaking). There is no mention of robustness against such attacks within its input modality.","evidence":"Section 3.1 (Feature Extraction): features are purely static URL/HTML (no dynamic or obfuscation defenses); Section 4 (Experiments): evaluation on clean 2K-PD, 50K-PD and 50K-IPD datasets with no adversarial or evasive manipulations considered."}
