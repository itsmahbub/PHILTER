{"value":"Medium","why":"CatchPhish relies on an inherently stable feature—brand identity—by using a Siamese network to detect typosquatting variations of known brand names, thus avoiding volatile URL‐based signals that tend to drift over time. However, its evaluation is performed on a single pooled dataset (synthetically generated and randomly split) without temporal separation between training and test sets, so it does not demonstrate resilience via time‐forward testing or continual adaptation.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “CatchPhish uses a Siamese neural network capable of identifying the presence of typosquatting mentions in phishing pages.”\nPage 4, Section III.A: “At the end of the construction, the data are divided into training and validation sets, respecting the proportion of 60% for training, 20% for test and 20% for validation.”\nPage 7, Section V: “For this experiment, 57,356 occurrences were collected … in the year 2020.”"}
