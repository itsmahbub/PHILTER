{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics—Precision, Recall, and F-score—for all experiments, but does not include any of the required summary metrics (AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC) needed to assess performance under class imbalance.","evidence":"Section IV (page 6): “The classification metrics such as Precision, Recall, F-score and Accuracy are considered to evaluate its performance.” No AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, or MCC is reported anywhere in the evaluation."}
