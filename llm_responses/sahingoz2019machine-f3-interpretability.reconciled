{"value":"Low","why":"Although the authors use decision trees and random forests, they do not expose any global or per-decision interpretability—no feature importance rankings, no extracted decision paths, and no post-hoc explanations (e.g., SHAP/LIME). All reported results are aggregate accuracy metrics, and the paper contains no mechanism for users or auditors to trace or explain individual classification decisions.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 5.1: models listed (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SMO, etc.) with no mention of explanations or feature analysis; Page 10, Section 5.5 and Table 5: only accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F-measure are reported—no feature importances or decision paths."}
