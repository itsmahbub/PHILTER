{"value":"Low","why":"DeltaPhish is designed specifically to detect phishing pages hosted on compromised websites and does not consider other common phishing tactics (e.g. HTTPS misuse, homograph attacks, IP-based URLs, lexical manipulations, subdomain spoofing, internal-system mimicry). The evaluation dataset is drawn solely from compromised sites and no quantitative or per-tactic breakdown is provided, indicating that tactic diversity is ignored.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (page 13): “To simulate this scenario, we collect legitimate and phishing webpages hosted in compromised websites from PhishTank… Overall, our dataset consists of 5,511 distinct webpages, 1,012 of which are phishing pages.” No other tactic categories or per-tactic performance results are reported."}
