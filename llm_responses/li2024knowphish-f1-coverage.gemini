    "why": "The paper's method is designed to address multiple phishing tactics by identifying brand intention from both visual (logos) and textual (HTML) content, making it robust to logo-less phishing and the use of varied logo versions. The threat model explicitly considers and addresses three categories of evasion attacks: 'Phishing with Logo Variants' (T1), 'Phishing with Text Brands' (T2), and 'HTML-oriented Attacks' (T3), which include typosquatting, prompt injection, and text-to-image attacks. The authors provide a quantitative performance evaluation against these specific, adversarially generated attacks in their robustness study. However, the evaluation falls short of the 'High' criteria because the primary evaluation on the main datasets (TR-OP and SG-SCAN) does not include a quantitative breakdown of the phishing tactics present within those datasets, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis for these real-world samples.",
    "evidence": "Page 4-5, Section 3: \"Evasion Attacks. The attackers may attempt to bypass fB via the following methods: T1: Phishing with Logo Variants. To circumvent the online knowledge expansion approach for B (e.g., DynaPhish [35]), attackers can use other legitimate logo variants of b instead of the ones displayed on b’s official webpages. T2: Phishing with Text Brands. Instead of using a logo to present its brand intention, the attacker can rely on text w.html to show its brand intention, making image-based phishing detectors completely fail. T3: HTML-oriented Attacks. Phishing attackers may employ evasion techniques on HTML, such as typosquatting, prompt injection, and text-to-image attacks to hinder effective information extraction by text-based methods.\" \nPage 12, Section 6.5 & Table 4: The paper studies robustness against specific evasion techniques: \"We study the robustness of our text-based components against three types of evasion techniques in HTML: Typosquatting... Prompt Injection... Text-to-Image.\" Table 4 then reports the accuracy of the Brand Extraction and CRP Classifier components when subjected to these attacks."
