    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a hybrid model (BGL-PhishNet) that analyzes lexical, structural, and metadata features of URLs, arguing it can handle sophisticated phishing tactics. However, the entire experimental evaluation is conducted on a static, pre-labeled dataset from Kaggle. The paper does not describe any experiments designed to test the model's resilience against active attacks. There is no evaluation against URLs that have been deliberately manipulated or obfuscated (e.g., through character substitution, URL shortening, or adversarial perturbations). The evaluation is limited to a standard binary classification task on a collection of known phishing and benign URLs, without any adversarial or evasive component in the test set. Although the case study mentions detecting features like \"deeply nested tags or invisible links,\" this is presented as an application finding, not a controlled experiment to measure robustness against a specific evasion technique.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section VI.A.1, \"Within this research, we have chosen the dataset labelled “Phishing Website URLs” sourced from Kaggle and consists of 549,346 URLs. Such a dataset is particularly valuable for training machine learning algorithms, as it includes a wide variety of both legitimate and phishing URLs... In the dataset, every URL is marked either for legitimate pages (0) or phishing pages (1), which serves as a target variable for modeling.\"\n\nPage 12, Section X, \"RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This section presents the results of the hybrid model for detection of phishing websites using BERT, GNN, and Light-GBM in an ensemble manner. Each of these models has been individually assessed for various performance metrics namely accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC-AUC to form a single unified model.\"\n\nPage 16, Table 6, \"Comparison with existing methods.\" The comparison against other models is based on standard classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC), indicating a benchmark on a non-adversarial task rather than a test of resilience to active attacks."
