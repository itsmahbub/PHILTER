    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation includes a diverse set of benign webpages by intentionally incorporating low-reputation or long-tail domains. The authors explicitly state they chose the DMOZ database over the Alexa top 100 to include \"less popular web pages\" and a \"mix of popular and less known websites,\" thus satisfying the first criterion of the metric. However, the paper does not provide any evidence that the benign dataset was specifically curated or analyzed to include the second key subset: pages with legitimate use of third-party brand elements (e.g., social media logos, payment provider buttons like PayPal). The dataset construction relies on random sampling from the DMOZ directory, which, while diverse, does not guarantee the inclusion or specific testing of this challenging category of benign pages that often trigger false positives in visual-based detectors. Therefore, as only one of the two criteria for a 'High' rating is met, the evaluation is 'Medium'.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section 4.2.2: \"The main advantage of using the DMOZ database over other sources for legitimate web pages often adopted in phishing research (e.g., the Alexa top 100 web pages [17]) is that this database contains also less popular web pages.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 4.2.2: \"However, while the DMOZ database only contains legitimate entries and is composed of a mix of popular and less known websites, it has not been updated since 2017.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 4.2.2: \"The benign dataset comprises 1,000 randomly sampled domains that met these constraints.\" (This implies a lack of specific selection for pages with legitimate brand element usage)."
