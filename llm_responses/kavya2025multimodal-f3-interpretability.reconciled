{"value":"High","why":"The TGNN-Att component provides per-decision explanations by computing and exposing attention weights for individual webpage components (nodes) at each timestamp. These attention scores indicate which specific features most influenced each classification, satisfying the ‘High’ criterion of per-decision explainability via attention-based mechanisms.","evidence":"Page 15, Table 9 (“Temporal graph neural network with attention (Tgnn-Att) node-level temporal analysis”) – shows an “Attention Weight” column assigning a numerical importance score to each node per time window (e.g., Hyperlink 1 has weights 0.80 and 0.85).  \nPage 7, Section III, Equations (6)–(8) – defines the self-attention mechanism used to compute these per-node attention weights."}
