    "why": "The paper's method, CatchPhish, is explicitly designed, trained, and evaluated to detect a single class of phishing tactic: homographic attacks, with a specific focus on typosquatting. The methodology revolves entirely around this tactic, from the synthetic dataset generation—which uses ten character-level manipulation rules to create typos—to the Siamese network's function of measuring string similarity to known brands. The paper does not address other prevalent phishing tactics such as HTTPS misuse, subdomain spoofing, URL redirection, or the use of compromised legitimate domains. The evaluation is based on a dataset of popular brands from PhishTank, but there is no analysis or breakdown of the tactics present in this dataset, nor is performance reported per tactic. The work's singular focus on typosquatting means it ignores the broader diversity of phishing tactics.",
    "evidence": "page 1, Abstract: 'CatchPhish uses a Siamese neural network capable of identifying the presence of typosquatting mentions in phishing pages.'\npage 4, Section III, A. Construction of the database: '...it was proposed to build an application capable of elaborating distorted terms (typosquatting) referring to the selected brands. such as “amoz0n”, “ltau”, “yah00”. In this process, ten characteristics already observed and discussed in the literature [19] were applied. These are: #01. Insert Neighbor Key Letter on Keyboard... #10. TLD simulation...'\npage 3, Section II-D, Related works: The paper critiques other works for 'total orientation of the models for the identification of typosquatting attacks, ignoring the presence of terms such as synonyms, abbreviations or words-key.' While this shows an awareness of sub-variations within lexical attacks, the proposed model itself remains confined to this single category and does not address other major tactic classes."
