{"value":"Low","why":"Phishpedia is evaluated on a pooled set of phishing pages without any categorization or per‐tactic analysis. The paper makes no attempt to quantify or break down performance across varied phishing tactics (e.g. homograph attacks, subdomain spoofing, hosting environments). Thus it ignores tactic diversity.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 5.2 (‘we compare Phishpedia with state-of-the-art phishing identification approaches… using six months of phishing URLs obtained from OpenPhish premium subscription’ – no per-tactic breakdown provided)"}
