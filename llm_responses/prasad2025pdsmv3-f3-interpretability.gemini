    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method is based on complex deep learning models (PDSMV3-DCRNN, Boosted ConvNeXt), which are inherently 'black-box' and lack per-decision traceability. The paper does not implement any post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP, LIME, or Grad-CAM to explain individual predictions. However, it does not qualify as a purely 'black-box' system because it provides global insight into its decision-making process. This is achieved through a feature selection phase using the Binary Grey Goose Optimization Algorithm (BGGOA), which identifies and uses an explicit set of 15 human-understandable URL features. The paper clearly lists these selected features, allowing an analyst to understand the general signals the model relies on, even if the reasoning for a specific URL classification is not exposed. This provision of global feature importance, without per-decision explanation, aligns with the criteria for 'Medium' interpretability.",
    "evidence": "page 10, Section 4.3.1, Table 2: The paper explicitly lists the 15 'Selected URL features' that the model uses for classification. This table includes human-understandable features like 'is_ip_address', 'length>30', 'dots>5', 'Domain_age>average_domain_age', and 'is_https'. This provides global insight into the model's decision criteria.\n\npage 5, Section 3.3: The paper details the 'Binary grey goose optimization algorithm (BGGOA) based feature selection' process. It states, 'Phishing detection demands a distinctive characteristic selection approach to extract the most relevant and discriminative characteristics... The BGGOA can focus on distinguishing elements by choosing the most informative data.' This confirms that a primary step is to identify globally important features before classification."
