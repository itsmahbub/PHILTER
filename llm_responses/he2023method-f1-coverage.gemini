    "why": "The paper proposes a URL-based detection method that uses Tiny-BERT to learn semantic and long-range dependency features from the URL string. This is a generalizable design choice that can be considered tactic-agnostic, as it does not rely on hand-crafted features tailored to specific, known phishing tactics (e.g., counting hyphens, checking for '@' symbols). Instead, it allows the model to learn malicious patterns directly from the data. This design implicitly addresses multiple URL-based tactics like lexical manipulations, subdomain spoofing, and other structural tricks that alter the semantic content of a URL. However, the paper's evaluation falls short of a high rating because it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the phishing tactics present in its Kaggle dataset, nor does it report the model's performance on a per-tactic basis. The evaluation treats all phishing URLs as a single category, providing only aggregate performance metrics.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"The core concept is to use tiny-Bert to extract features from website URL strings, and learn the semantic features and long-range dependent features in URLs. Then, we build a Stacking algorithm-based classifier... This detection model can identify phishing websites without manual feature extraction...\"\n\nPage 2, Section I: \"On the one hand, existing URL segmentation tools essentially only obtain word or character information in the URL, unable to analyze the order and semantic features of the URL, and have defects in obtaining long-range dependency information in the URL.\"\n\nPage 5, Section IV-A, Data Set: \"Our data set is from Kaggle [28], which provides public data sets. The data set contains a total of 549 346 URLs (72% for legal URL samples and 28% for phishing URL samples).\" — This is the full extent of the dataset description; it lacks any information about the diversity of phishing tactics within the samples."
