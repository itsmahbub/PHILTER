    "why": "The paper's method, DeltaPhish, is explicitly designed to detect a single, albeit important, phishing tactic: webpages hosted on compromised legitimate domains. The entire detection mechanism is predicated on comparing a suspicious page to the homepage of the domain it is hosted on. This specialized design means it is inherently unable to address a wide range of other common tactics, such as those involving URL manipulation (subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks), hosting on purpose-built malicious domains, or abuse of legitimate hosting services. The paper's evaluation reinforces this narrow scope. The dataset was constructed specifically by collecting phishing pages from compromised websites and their corresponding legitimate homepages, thus containing no information or quantitative breakdown of tactic diversity. The authors also explicitly acknowledge this limitation, stating the method cannot detect phishing hosted by other means.",
    "evidence": "Page 3, Section 1: 'The key idea behind our approach, named DeltaPhish... is to compare the HTML code and the visual appearance of potential phishing pages against the corresponding characteristics of the homepage of the compromised (hosting) website.'\nPage 12, Section 4.1: 'Our dataset has been collected... starting from active phishing URLs obtained online from the PhishTank feed... For each phishing page, we have then collected the corresponding homepage from the hosting domain... Overall, our dataset consists of 5,511 distinct webpages, 1,012 of which are phishing pages.'\nPage 17, Section 5: 'our proposal has its own limitations. It is clearly not able to detect phishing pages hosted through other means than compromised websites.'"
