{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation of the proposed detector is performed on benign pages drawn from Alexa’s Top Sites (high‐reputation/popular domains) and standard public URL datasets, with no inclusion of long‐tail or recently registered domains nor any deliberate sampling of pages embedding legitimate brand elements (e.g. PayPal/OAuth widgets, social media buttons, logos).","evidence":"Section 3.2 Data Acquisition: “legitimate URLs were collected from Alexa”; Section 5.2 Dataset Selection: evaluation uses only Alexa‐sourced legitimate URLs and standard public URL/HTML datasets, without low‐reputation or brand‐element subsets."}
