    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper does not propose a method that is inherently adaptive to concept drift (e.g., via online learning or dynamic feature updates). The recommended solution is a standard TF-IDF feature extraction with a Logistic Regression classifier, which is trained in a static, offline manner. However, a core contribution of the research is a rigorous evaluation of concept drift's impact on phishing detection models. The authors explicitly test for this by training various models on datasets from older years (2016, 2017) and evaluating their performance on more recent datasets (2017, 2020). This temporal evaluation methodology directly aligns with the metric's criteria for demonstrating robustness over time. By showing a clear degradation in performance, the paper validates the problem of concept drift and concludes that models must be retrained with recent data. Therefore, while the proposed method is not adaptive by design, the evaluation protocol directly addresses concept drift, earning a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section B. ANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF PHISHING MODELS OVER TIME: \"To prove if this hypothesis is correct, we used PWD2016 and Ebbu2017 and the features from Sahingoz et al. [21] to train eight machine learning models (see Table 7) and test them using URLs from recent years. These datasets are 1M-PD from 2017, PIU-60K from 2020 and PLU-60K also from 2020.\"\n\nPage 9, Table 7, \"Phishing detection accuracy evolution over time (in %)\": This table presents the core results of the temporal evaluation, showing accuracy drops when models trained on older data (PWD2016, Ebbu2017) are tested on newer data (1M-PD, PIU-60K, PLU-60K). For example, LightGBM trained on PWD2016 scores 97.60% accuracy but drops to 87.18% on PIU-60K.\n\nPage 9, Section B: \"From the experimental results shown in Table 7, all models struggled to endure over time and their performance decreased when tested on the following years’ datasets.\""
