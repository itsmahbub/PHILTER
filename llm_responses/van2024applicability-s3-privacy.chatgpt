{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed framework requires sending full URLs (including all path and parameters), complete HTML content, and full DOM tree structures to be analyzed by external deep models, with no mention of client-side or in-boundary inference or any privacy-preserving measures (e.g. hashing, sanitization, or federated learning).","evidence":"Page 8, Section 4.2 (“the proof of concept … analyze the URL, HTML content, and HTML DOM tree structure”); Page 9 (“we transform the HTML code into a string”); no inference-time data-handling or privacy safeguards are described."}
