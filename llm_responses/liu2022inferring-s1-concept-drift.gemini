    "why": "The paper proposes PhishIntention, a method designed to be robust against evolving phishing tactics (concept drift) by focusing on stable, high-level visual and dynamic features rather than volatile signals like HTML code. It infers \"brand intention\" (e.g., logos) and \"credential-taking intention\" (e.g., input field layout), which are fundamental to a phishing page's purpose and less likely to change than implementation details. This design choice inherently addresses concept drift by avoiding volatile features. Crucially, the paper validates this robustness with a rigorous temporal evaluation. It conducts a two-month field study where the pre-trained system is tested against a live, real-time feed of newly registered websites from CertStream. This ensures the test data is temporally distinct from and more recent than the training data, directly measuring the system's ability to handle new, \"in-the-wild\" phishing attacks. The combination of a drift-resistant design and a forward-looking evaluation protocol fulfills the \"High\" criteria.",
    "evidence": "Page 14, Section 10, RQ5: Phishing Discovery Experiment: The paper describes a field study to evaluate performance on emerging threats. Section 10.1.1 states: \"We choose CertStream [1] for feeding the webpage crawling system. CertStream is a free online service which provides users with real-time feeds of URLs issued with new certificates.\" Section 10.1.2 specifies the evaluation period: \"The discovery experiment is carried out for two months starting from April 2021.\" This setup ensures that the model, trained on historical data, is tested against contemporary, previously unseen phishing websites, directly evaluating its resilience to concept drift."
