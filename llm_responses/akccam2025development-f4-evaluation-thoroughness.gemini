    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the proposed model. The authors explicitly define and then report on all the required metrics. They present class-sensitive metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) for both the phishing and legitimate classes across multiple datasets and experimental configurations. Additionally, they include a summary metric, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), to provide an overall measure of classification quality. This thorough approach ensures a meaningful assessment of the model's performance, particularly in contexts with potential class imbalance, fully meeting the criteria for a high rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 18, Section 5.1, 'Classification metrics': The paper defines the metrics used: \"including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under Curve (AUC). The concept of 'accuracy' is denoted by the proportion of correct predictions... Precision is defined as the proportion of accurately predicted positive instances... The recall metric represents the proportion of samples correctly identified as positive... The F1-score is a statistical metric that takes the harmonic mean of precision and recall values... The AUC encapsulates the total area beneath the ROC curve, concisely summarising the model’s overall performance.\"\n\nPage 24, Table 11, 'Classification metric values of the proposed model at different URLs lengths.': This table explicitly reports the results for all required metrics. It contains columns for 'Test Accuracy', 'Class', 'Precision', 'Recall', 'F1-Score', and 'AUC' for three different datasets (GramBeddings, Malicious and Benign URLs, Ebbu2017 Phishing), demonstrating a complete and transparent evaluation."
