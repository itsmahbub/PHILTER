{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving deployment or data-handling mechanisms. It processes full URLs (including query parameters), webpage text, and metadata on external servers without mention of on-device inference, hashed lookups, federated learning, or anonymized feature vectors.","evidence":"Section VI.A. Dataset and preprocessing (pages 6–7): full URLs and metadata are collected from Kaggle and sent through cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction on external infrastructure; no client-side or privacy-preserving mechanism is described."}
