    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper consistently uses class-sensitive metrics appropriate for the imbalanced nature of phishing detection. The main evaluation (RQ1) and subsequent field studies explicitly measure and report Precision and Recall. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the need to evaluate false positives and false negatives separately, which is crucial in this domain. However, the evaluation lacks any of the required summary metrics (AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC) that would provide a more holistic view of the classifier's performance across different thresholds or by combining all confusion matrix components. Because it includes key class-sensitive metrics but omits a summary metric, it meets the criteria for a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section 4.2.1, Setup: \"To answer RQ1, we use the phishing detection benchmark (6K phishing + 6K benign dataset). We compare PhishLLM and the baselines in terms of their overall classification performance, measured in precision, recall, and runtime overhead.\"\n\nPage 9, Table 3, Overall Performance: This table presents the core evaluation results with columns explicitly for 'Precision' and 'Recall' for the proposed method and all baselines.\n\nPage 13, Table 7, Overall performance in the large-scale field study: This table reinforces the evaluation methodology by reporting 'Precision' and 'Recall' for the field study."
