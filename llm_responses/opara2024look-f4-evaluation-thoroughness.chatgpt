{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and plots ROC and precision–recall curves but does not present any numeric summary metric (AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC or MCC) to quantify overall classifier performance under class imbalance. Thus, it lacks full metric coverage as defined in the codebook.","evidence":"Section 4.4 (page 6): “We evaluated the performance … using Recall, Precision, Accuracy … We also used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the precision–recall curve …” ; Table 3 (page 8): reports Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score but no AUC or MCC value."}
