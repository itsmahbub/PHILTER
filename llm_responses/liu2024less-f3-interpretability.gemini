The overall phishing decision is based on two transparent factors: (1) an inconsistency between the detected brand and the page's domain, and (2) the presence of credential-taking intention. The paper explicitly states that the language model inherently provides explanations. Most significantly, for the credential-taking prediction (CRP) component, the system uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which forces the model to output a step-by-step textual justification for its classification. This justification identifies the specific sensitive keywords and login-related terms it found on the page, providing a clear, per-decision explanation of its reasoning path.",
