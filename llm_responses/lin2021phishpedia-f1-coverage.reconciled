{"value":"Medium","why":"Phishpedia employs a modality-agnostic design that is inherently resilient to varied phishing tactics observable in URLs (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, lexical manipulations, hosting on shared/compromised domains) by relying on logo recognition and domain-difference analysis. However, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the evaluation dataset by phishing tactic nor report per-tactic performance metrics, which precludes a High rating under the codebook. Thus, it meets the criteria for Medium: it addresses multiple tactics by design but lacks explicit per-tactic evaluation.","evidence":"Page 2, Section 2.2 Overview: “Once a logo in the target brand list … we analyze the difference between the intended domain and the domain of the given URL to report the phishing result.” (tactic-agnostic design) \nPage 11, Section 5.4 Phishpedia generalization (RQ3): evaluation of adding unseen logos shows generalizability, but no per-tactic breakdown. \nPage 8, Section 5.2: evaluation uses a pooled 6-month OpenPhish dataset with no categorization or quantitative analysis of different phishing tactics."}
