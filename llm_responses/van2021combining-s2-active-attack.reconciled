{"value": "Low", "why": "Although the paper argues that screenshot‐based analysis inherently avoids certain source‐level evasions (e.g., image splitting, CSS‐only rendering), it contains no experimental evaluation against any active or adversarial manipulations. All performance results (Sections 4.2–4.4) are obtained on unaltered phishing and benign pages, without testing obfuscated JavaScript, deferred execution, cloaking, adversarial perturbations, or other evasive techniques. Thus, it provides no demonstrated robustness to active attacks in its modality.", "evidence": "Section 4.2 (Data collection): phishing and benign datasets are sampled from real feeds and directories with no modifications; Section 4.3 (Target identification performance): all accuracy figures are on these raw datasets, and no evaluation of any adversarial or evasive manipulations is described."}
