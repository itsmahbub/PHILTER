    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper explicitly identifies concept drift as a major challenge, stating that \"Phishing attacks constantly evolve, and new attack techniques and patterns emerge regularly.\" The core of the proposed method, PhiUSIIL, is an incremental learning framework specifically designed to address this issue. It allows the model to continuously update itself with new data without full retraining, making it inherently adaptive. The evaluation protocol directly reflects this adaptive design by simulating a time-forward deployment. The dataset was collected over an 8-month period (October 2022 to May 2023). The model is initialized on the first data point and then, for every subsequent record, it first makes a prediction and then incrementally trains on that new record. This sequential predict-then-train process on a time-stamped dataset is a robust form of temporal evaluation. By employing an adaptive strategy by design and using a time-aware evaluation protocol, the paper fully meets the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 2, Section 1: \"The proposed machine learning-based phishing URL detection approach is based on incremental learning. Incremental learning is a machine learning technique where a model can continuously learn from new data, reducing the need for full retraining... It enables the model to stay up-to-date, making it adaptable to changing data.\"\n\nPage 10, Algorithm 3: The algorithm shows a loop processing data records sequentially. For each record 'i', the model first performs a prediction (line 17: `pr = model.predict(X)`) and then immediately uses that same record for training (line 19: `model.partial_fit(X, Y, classes = [0, 1])`). This simulates a continuous learning process over time.\n\nPage 5, Section 3.1.1: \"We continuously monitored anti-phishing sites and downloaded over 100000 phishing webpages from October 2022 to May 2023.\" This confirms the dataset spans a significant time period, enabling a meaningful temporal evaluation."
