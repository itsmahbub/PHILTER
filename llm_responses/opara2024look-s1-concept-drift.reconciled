{"value":"Medium","why":"WebPhish is explicitly designed to avoid brittle, hand‐crafted features by learning directly from raw URL character and HTML word embeddings—an inherently more stable, semantic representation that mitigates the need to update features as attacker tactics evolve. However, its evaluation relies solely on random k-fold cross-validation rather than any temporally disjoint (train-old/test-new) protocol. Thus, it meets the criterion of ‘avoiding volatile features by design’ but does not perform a temporal split, placing it at the ‘Medium’ level.","evidence":"Design avoids hand-crafted, volatile features: Page 2, Contributions: “Manual feature engineering is reduced as WebPhish learns the representation in the features of the HTML document, and we do not depend on any third-party system.”\nNo temporal evaluation: Page 6, Section 4.3: “We conducted all WebPhish and baseline experiments … using the K-fold cross-validation technique with k set to 5.” No train-old/test-new split is described."}
