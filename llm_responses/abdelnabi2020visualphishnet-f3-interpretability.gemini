    "why": "The proposed method, VisualPhishNet, is based on a triplet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn a visual embedding space. This type of deep learning model is inherently a black box. The detection decision is made by comparing the distance between a query page's embedding and the embeddings of a trusted set of pages against a threshold. The model does not provide any insight into which visual features or regions of the input image contributed to this distance calculation. The paper does not mention the use of any post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Grad-CAM, SHAP, or LIME to generate per-decision explanations (e.g., heatmaps). While the authors provide t-SNE visualizations of the embedding space and conduct a detailed qualitative analysis of failure modes, these are external analyses to validate the model's overall behavior rather than an integrated feature of the method that explains individual predictions to a user or auditor.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section 5, VISUALPHISHNET: \"Our network, VisualPhishNet, adopts the triplet network paradigm with three shared convolutional networks... The overall objective of the network is to learn a feature space in which the distance between the positive and anchor images, embeddings... is smaller than the distance between the anchor and negative images’ ones.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 5.3, Prediction: \"At test time, the closest screenshot in distance to a phishing test page is ideally a screenshot of the same website... we classify a test screenshot as a phishing page if its minimum distance to the trusted-list is smaller than a defined threshold... if the distance is not low enough, the page would be classified as a legitimate one with a genuine identity.\"\n\nPages 10-11, Section 7, DISCUSSION: The discussion provides a manual, post-hoc analysis of correct and incorrect classifications by categorizing them and evaluating failure modes. This demonstrates the authors' effort to understand their model but is not an interpretability feature of the method itself. The model does not automatically generate these explanations."
