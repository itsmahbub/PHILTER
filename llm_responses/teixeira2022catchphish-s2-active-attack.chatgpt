{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates CatchPhish solely on a synthetically generated dataset of lexical typosquatting variants and reports accuracy on these cleanly perturbed strings. It does not assess robustness against any active evasion techniques (e.g. junk HTML, obfuscated JavaScript, Base64 payloads, dynamic content loading or adversarial perturbations) within its text‐based input scope.","evidence":"Page 4, Section III.A: “Finally, the characteristics are applied randomly to the pre-selected brands… giving rise to a labeled database, composed of 33,077 distorted terms. At the end of the construction, the data are divided into training and validation sets…”  (No further evaluation of active evasive manipulations is described.)"}
