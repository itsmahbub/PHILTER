    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper evaluates its URL-based deep learning model using standard, static datasets (Phish Storm, Phish Tank, ISCX, Kaggle). The experiments consist of training and testing on these clean datasets to measure classification performance (accuracy, F1, etc.). There is no mention or evidence of the method being evaluated against active attacks or adversarial manipulations relevant to its input modality (the URL string). The authors do not test against obfuscated URLs, adversarial examples, or other common URL-based evasion techniques. Furthermore, the paper explicitly states limitations that represent vulnerabilities to active attacks, such as an inability to handle short URLs (a form of redirection/obfuscation) and truncating URLs longer than 200 characters, which could allow attackers to hide malicious patterns.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section D. COMPARISON, Table 6: The 'Limitations' column for the proposed RNN-GRU model lists: 'Short URLs are not supported;' and 'URLs of more than 200 characters will lose some of their features'. This acknowledges a lack of resilience to common evasion techniques without providing any evaluation of their impact. \nPage 5, Section III, subsection 3) FEATURE EXTRACTION: 'Because of the calculation time of the deep learning model and the analysis of the statistical data of the existing data set, we set the maximum number of URL characters to 200.' This design choice, while practical, is a vulnerability that was not tested against adversarially crafted long URLs. \nPage 9, Section V. EVALUATION RESULTS: The entire evaluation section describes experiments conducted on splits of pre-existing, non-adversarial datasets. The methodology focuses on comparing model performance on these static datasets, not on their robustness to deliberate evasion."
