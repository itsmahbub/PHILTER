    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper reports all the required class-sensitive metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) and provides their formulas, demonstrating a clear understanding of their importance beyond simple accuracy. However, the evaluation lacks any of the specified summary metrics (AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC) that are necessary for a comprehensive assessment of classifier performance, especially under class imbalance. While the provided metrics are valuable, the absence of a summary metric prevents the evaluation from meeting the 'High' criteria.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section IV, EXPERIMENTATION RESULTS: \"The classification metrics such as Precision, Recall, F-score and Accuracy are considered to evaluate its performance... The calculation of each metric is as follows: • Precision = NTP/(NTP+NFP) x 100, • Recall = NTP/(NTP+NFN) x 100, • F-sore = 2*precision*Recall/(precision+Recall) x 100\". The results in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (pages 7-8) consistently report these metrics but do not include AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC."
