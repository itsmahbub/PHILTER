    "why": "The proposed method is tactic-agnostic by design. It relies on visual similarity between a suspicious webpage and a known legitimate target, using screenshots as input. This approach inherently bypasses many URL-based and code-based evasion tactics (e.g., code obfuscation, subdomain spoofing, hosting on compromised domains) because it only evaluates the final rendered page. The authors explicitly state that their method is resilient to code obfuscation. By being generalizable in this way, it addresses multiple phishing tactics whose end goal is visual impersonation. However, the evaluation does not explicitly measure the method's effectiveness against a diverse set of tactics. The paper uses a phishing dataset from PhishTank but does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the tactics present in the dataset (e.g., number of sites using HTTPS, hosted on shared domains, etc.) or report performance on a per-tactic basis, which prevents it from meeting the 'High' criteria.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: 'Since our method does not rely on text and code features, it is resilient to code obfuscation.'\nPage 2, Section III, Phishing set: 'We use PhishTank to obtain ground truth data on phishing sites. We crawl the landing page of each site reported on Phishtank on 2019-02-01 if it was also in our Alexa Top10K list. We then manually verified all sites and marked true positives. After removing duplicates, we obtain 113 phishing screenshots belonging to 22 domains.'\nPage 4, Table I: The performance table presents aggregated precision and recall metrics across the entire test set, without breaking down the results by different phishing attack types or tactics."
