    "why": "The method is designed to be resilient to concept drift by anchoring its detection mechanism in a stable, identity-based feature: the website logo. The authors argue that the relationship between a brand's logo and its official domain name is exclusive and persistent, unlike more volatile features (e.g., URL structure, textual content) that are subject to rapid evolution in phishing tactics. By using Google's reverse image search to verify this logo-domain relationship, the system leverages a core, semantic aspect of a website's identity that is difficult for attackers to subvert without undermining the visual deception itself. This reliance on a stable graphical feature fulfills one key criterion of the metric. However, the paper's evaluation protocol does not test this hypothesis against concept drift. The datasets are not separated by time (e.g., training on old samples and testing on new ones), so the method's long-term robustness is a plausible design benefit rather than an empirically validated claim.",
