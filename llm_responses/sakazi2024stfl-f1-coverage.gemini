    "why": "The proposed method is a URL character-based approach using a Bi-LSTM autoencoder. This design is inherently tactic-agnostic, as it learns the general sequence and structure of 'normal' URLs and identifies phishing as anomalous deviations. This allows it to implicitly address a variety of URL-based phishing tactics, such as lexical manipulations (misspellings, unusual characters) and structural abuse (e.g., complex subdomains), without being explicitly programmed for each one. The method's strength lies in its ability to capture these general patterns. However, the evaluation section lacks any explicit consideration of tactic diversity. While the datasets used (e.g., sourcing from PhishTank) likely contain a wide variety of real-world phishing tactics, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of these tactics within the datasets, nor does it report performance on a per-tactic basis. Therefore, it addresses multiple tactics by its generalizable design but does not provide the per-tactic evaluation required for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 3, Section IV, Training procedure: \"In this paper, we focus on the URL character-based approach... By using a Bi-LSTM in the autoencoder, the autoencoder can capture the lexical dependencies between the characters from left-to-right and right-to-left in the sequential data. To build the Bi-LSTM autoencoder network, we divide the URL into three parts which are represented as one-hot encoding: domain and top level domain (TLD), sub-domain, and the path... The goal is to analyze all of the parts in order to obtain as much information as possible from each part.\"\n\nPage 4, Section V.A, Datasets: The paper describes the datasets used (CPURNN, PDRCNN, Khramtsova et al.) by their sources (PhishTank, Common Crawl, etc.) and the total number of phishing and benign URLs. There is no mention or analysis of the specific phishing tactics (e.g., homograph, subdomain spoofing, IP-based URLs) contained within these datasets. The evaluation reports aggregate metrics like F1 score and accuracy, without breaking down performance by tactic type."
