    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The evaluation partially addresses the diversity of benign pages by including a \"long-tail\" or niche dataset in its case study, which focuses on agricultural websites. This dataset includes legitimate sites that are not mainstream high-reputation domains, with varying domain ages, satisfying one of the metric's criteria.\n\nHowever, the paper does not receive a 'High' rating because it provides no evidence of evaluating the model on the second key criterion: benign pages that make legitimate use of brand elements (e.g., PayPal/OAuth widgets, social media buttons, embedded logos). The feature extraction focuses on lexical, structural, and metadata features but does not discuss the challenge of distinguishing legitimate brand usage from brand impersonation, a common cause of false positives. Since only one of the two specified diversity subsets is addressed, the evaluation is rated as 'Medium'.",
    "evidence": "Page 16, Section XI: The paper explicitly uses a niche, long-tail dataset for a case study: \"XI. CASE STUDY: REAL-TIME DETECTION OF PHISHING THREATS IN AGRICULTURAL WEBSITES USING BGL-PHISHNET... In our study on phishing detection for agricultural websites, we analyzed a real-time dataset collected from various online sources. This dataset includes both legitimate and phishing websites related to agriculture.\"\n\nPage 17, Table 7: The sample dataset for the case study includes legitimate websites with varying domain ages, such as `www.agrishop.com` (365 days) and `www.cropinfoportal.com` (730 days), which are not typical top-ranked domains."
