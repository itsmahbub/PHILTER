{"value":"High","why":"The paper explicitly evaluates AdaptPUD against a diverse set of actively evasive, real-world tailored deceptive URLs—abusing cloud-hosted domains, URL shorteners, look-alike domains via typosquatting, and non-standard Pinyin domains—and achieves 100% detection on these 20 fresh P-URLs while baselines largely fail. This demonstrates robustness against active URL-level evasion techniques within its claimed URL-based scope.","evidence":"Page 10, Section 5.4 “Practical application”: “In January 2025, we collected 30 active P-URLs… categorizing them into general P-URLs and tailored deceptive P-URLs… AdaptPUD performs exceptionally well across both categories, with 100% detection accuracy…”. Table 7 shows AdaptPUD (AP) correctly detects all 20 tailored deceptive P-URLs employing evasion methods such as cloud platform subdomains, URL shorteners (t.ly, qrco.de), typosquatting domains, and Pinyin domains."}
