    "why": "The paper demonstrates consideration for multiple phishing tactics through its comprehensive feature engineering. The authors explicitly state their goal is to create a model that can handle a \"wide range of attack routes\" and selected features intended to \"capture the complex nature of phishing attempts.\" The feature set detailed in Table 2 includes indicators for various tactics, such as the use of IP addresses (`IpAddress`), misuse of HTTPS (`NoHttps`), subdomain manipulations (`SubdomainLevel`, `DomainInSubdomains`), and lexical manipulations (`NumDashInHostname`, `RandomString`). This shows a clear intent to address tactic diversity. However, the evaluation lacks the depth required for a 'High' rating. The study uses a single Kaggle dataset and does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the different phishing tactics present within it. Consequently, the performance is reported only in aggregate metrics (e.g., overall accuracy, F1-score), without any per-tactic analysis to show how well the model performs against specific types of attacks.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section IV.D, DATA DIVERSITY: \"The cornerstone of any strong phishing detection model is its capacity to recognize and adjust to a wide range of attack routes. Our dataset in this study, which is described in great length in the feature description that is provided (Table 2), is evidence of the purposeful selection of features intended to capture the complex nature of phishing attempts. Our feature set includes structural aspects like the path's double slashes, the hostname's length, and the URL's constituent parts, as well as more subtle semantic markers like email submissions of information and the appearance of random sequences.\"\n\nPage 7, Table 2. Summary of features in the phishing detection dataset: The table lists features like `IpAddress`, `NoHttps`, `SubdomainLevel`, `DomainInSubdomains`, and `RandomString` which directly map to known phishing tactics.\n\nPage 15, Table 4. Comparing the proposed RNT-J model's performance with current models: The evaluation is presented through aggregate metrics such as ROC, AUC, Recall, MCC, Precision, F1-Score, and Accuracy, without a breakdown by phishing tactic."
