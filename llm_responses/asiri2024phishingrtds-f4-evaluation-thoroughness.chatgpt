{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics—precision, recall, and F1-score—but does not include any summary metric such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or Matthews Correlation Coefficient, which are necessary to fully evaluate performance under class imbalance.","evidence":"Section 4.3 (Evaluation Metrics): “We evaluate our model using the Accuracy, True positive rate (TPR), Precision, and F1 score.” No AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC are reported."}
