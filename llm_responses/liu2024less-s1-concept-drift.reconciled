{"value":"High","why":"PhishLLM is explicitly designed to avoid volatile, manually maintained reference lists by leveraging stable semantic features (brand identity via LLM-decoded brand-domain relationships and credential-taking intention). Moreover, its evaluation protocol includes a large-scale, time-forward deployment on newly issued domains (CertStream feeds over 30 days), providing a temporally disjoint test set that demonstrates resilience to future, unseen phishing campaigns. Together, these satisfy both criteria for a “High” rating under the Adaptation to Concept Drift metric.","evidence":"Page 2, Abstract: “modern LLMs have encoded far more extensive brand-domain information than any predefined list…without the cost of maintaining and updating an explicit reference list.”; Page 8, Section 4.5.1: “Field Study Evaluation: CertStream Service … crawling lasted for 30 days, yielding a total of 90,000 websites.”"}
