{"value":"Low","why":"The paper presents a static, feature‐based detector evaluated only on clean phishing versus benign pages, with no tests against active evasions (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, deferred execution, cloaking, or adversarially perturbed inputs) within its claimed scope. Thus it provides no evidence of robustness to active attacks.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 5 (Evaluation): “All pages collected are in English language and contain at least one text input…we conducted two experiments with two different testing dataset to evaluate the performance of our method…The true positive rate…false positive rate…” – no mention of adversarial or evasive manipulations."}
