    "value": "High",
    "why": "The proposed model, while based on the typically opaque BiLSTM architecture, explicitly incorporates an Attention layer in both its character-based and word-based processing streams. Attention mechanisms provide a form of per-decision explanation by generating weights that indicate which parts of the input URL (specific characters or words) were most influential in the classification decision. This allows for the creation of heatmaps or highlighting important features for any given prediction, directly fulfilling the 'High' criterion which specifies \"attention- or gradient-based heatmaps\" as a method for per-decision explanation.",
    "evidence": "page 14, Figure 10, 'Proposed model architecture.' The diagram clearly depicts an 'Attention Layer' following the 'BiLSTM Layer' in both the character and word processing branches.\n\npage 15, Algorithm 1, lines 56 and 62. The algorithm explicitly includes the attention layer: \"56: The output of the BiLSTM is forwarded to an attention layer. % This allows for the focus on specific parts of the BiLSTM output.\" and \"62: The output of the BiLSTM is transmitted to an attention layer.\"\n\npage 16, Section 4.3.2, 'Attention Layer'. The paper describes the function of this layer: \"The Attention layer employs a weighting system, whereby different inputs are assigned differing weights according to the logic governing its functioning. The attention weight is calculated to ensure that specific inputs are given priority. Consequently, the model prioritises the processing of crucial information.\""
