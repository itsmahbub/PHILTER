{"value":"High","why":"The method inherently provides per‐decision explanations by localizing and exposing the logo region (via a bounding‐box overlay) and by reporting the exact brand the page is imitating. Users can see which part of the page (the logo) drove the classification and the identified target brand, then compare the predicted (legitimate) URL to the actual URL. This satisfies the “High” criterion of per‐decision interpretability through bounding‐box overlays and transparent decision reasoning.","evidence":"Page 2, Section 2: “Second, by visually comparing webpages with predefined legitimate references, the proposed model can identify phishing pages along with their target brand, thereby providing explainable results.”\nPage 3, Section 3.3: “The object detection model takes as input a webpage screenshot and generates a bounding box to annotate the webpage’s logo region.”\nPage 3, Section 3.2: “Finally, a prediction result is derived by comparing the predicted URL with the input URL. If the input URL is different from the predicted URL, it will be identified as a phishing website; otherwise, it will be identified as a benign website.”"}
