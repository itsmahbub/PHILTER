    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper neither implements any adaptive strategy (e.g., continual learning or periodic retraining) nor does it claim or demonstrate the use of inherently stable features specifically chosen to resist phishing concept drift. Its evaluation protocol relies solely on random i.i.d. splits of static datasets with no temporal separation of training and test sets, indicating an assumption of a stationary phishing URL distribution.",
    "evidence": "Section 4.4 Train-Validation-Test Split: “Therefore, the datasets were initially randomly divided into two distinct subsets in an 80–20 ratio, one designated for training and the other for testing. Subsequently, the training dataset underwent another random split into training and validation subsets, also in an 80–20 ratio.”"
