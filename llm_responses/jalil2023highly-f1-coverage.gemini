    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method is URL-based and its feature engineering explicitly targets multiple, diverse phishing tactics observable in URL strings. Features are designed to detect HTTPS misuse, subdomain spoofing, lexical manipulations (e.g., suspicious words, special characters, URL length), and brand impersonation. This demonstrates a clear consideration for tactic diversity in the model's design. However, the evaluation does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the test datasets by tactic, nor does it report the model's performance against specific tactics. The results are presented in aggregate, preventing an analysis of the method's effectiveness on different types of phishing attacks.",
    "evidence": "The paper's feature set addresses multiple tactics:\n- **HTTPS Misuse**: Feature `H3: Having_https` checks for the 'Presence of HTTPS protocol in URL'.\n- **Subdomain Spoofing**: Features `H1: Dot_host` ('Number of dots in the host') and `H2: Len_subdomain` ('Length of subdomain') are used.\n- **Lexical Manipulation**: Features like `F8: Suspwords_url` ('Presence of suspicious words in URL'), `F3: Delims_url` ('Presence of delimiters'), and `F5: Len_url` ('Length of the URL') are included.\n- **Brand Impersonation**: Features `H4: Brand_host` and `P11: Brand_path` check for the 'Presence of popular brand names in host' and 'Presence of brand name in the path', respectively. The paper states: 'Brand name-based features We have collected top 500 popular brand names from Alexa. The features included in this category are H4 and P11. We have used a technique named as TF-IDF for matching a brand name in the URL.' (Page 10, Section 'Brand name-based features').\n\nHowever, the evaluation lacks a per-tactic breakdown. The experimental results, presented in Tables 5 through 10 (Pages 13-15), show aggregate performance metrics (TPR, FPR, Accuracy, etc.) for each dataset without analyzing performance against specific phishing tactics."
