    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper evaluates its URL-based phishing detection method on six standard, static benchmark datasets. The experiments are designed to measure classification performance (accuracy, FPR, etc.) on these pre-collected datasets. There is no mention of testing the model against active attacks, such as adversarial examples where URL strings are intentionally manipulated to evade detection. The methodology consists of training and testing on existing phishing and benign URLs, which aligns with the definition of a 'clean' benchmark without adversarial or evasive manipulation. The paper's own limitations section acknowledges that URLs not matching known patterns might be misclassified, but it does not present any experiments to test this resilience.",
    "evidence": "Page 13, Section 4.1: \"The goal of this experiment is to determine the best classifier for phishing detection among the various ML classifiers. The dataset was partitioned into 70% for training and 30% for testing the model.\" This describes a standard classification evaluation, not a test against active attacks.\n\nPage 8, Section 3.1 & Table 2: The paper describes its data sources as standard repositories like Kaggle and collections from prior literature. There is no indication that these datasets contain URLs specifically crafted for evasion or adversarial testing.\n\nPage 17, Section 5 (Limitations): \"The framework first limitation is that, because the features are taken from the URL, it may misclassify some phishing URLs hosted on free hosting providers. Phishing URLs exist that do not match the patterns of known phishing sites. This might lead to such URLs being misclassified as valid.\" This statement confirms the model relies on known patterns and acknowledges a potential vulnerability to URLs that deviate from these patterns (a form of evasion), but the paper does not conduct any experiments to evaluate its robustness against such deviations."
