{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed hybrid framework neither implements any adaptive strategies (e.g. continual learning, periodic retraining, or time-aware feature engineering) nor relies on features identified as inherently stable against drift. Moreover, its evaluation uses a single random split of data (70%/20%/10%) from the same time period, without any temporal hold-out or time-forward testing to assess resilience to evolving phishing tactics.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 4.2: “We do not focus on the other factors of applicability for the proof of concept. These require a more extensive and qualitative-oriented analysis, which falls outside the scope of this study.”; Page 10, Section 5.1: “For training, we split them into a training (70%), validation (20%) and testing (10%) subset.”"}
