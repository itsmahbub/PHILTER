{"value":"Low","why":"The paper presents a high-performing stacked ensemble of black-box classifiers (MLP, KNN, RF, LR, XGB) but does not include any mechanism—neither inherently interpretable models nor post hoc XAI methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention or gradient heatmaps)—to explain individual predictions or expose decision paths. All results focus solely on aggregate performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F-score).","evidence":"Page 5, Section IV: “The classification metrics such as Precision, Recall, F-score and Accuracy are considered to evaluate its performance.” No other sections propose or discuss any form of explanation or interpretability technique."}
