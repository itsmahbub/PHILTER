{"value":"Low","why":"The paper provides no evaluation of the proposed method under any active attack or evasive manipulation. All experiments use clean phishing samples from PhishTank and benign sites from Alexa, without testing resilience to obfuscations, dynamic content loading, injected junk elements, adversarial perturbations, or other active evasion techniques.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 3.3 (“Experimental results”): “We have constructed two non-overlapping datasets from a total of 1140 webpages. The webpages consist of phishing and legitimate webpages. Phishing webpages are downloaded from PhishTank and legitimate webpages are from Alexa … The final detection performance of the whole proposed method is measured using dataset 2.”"}
