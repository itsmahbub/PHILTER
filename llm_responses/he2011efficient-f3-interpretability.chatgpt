{"value":"Low","why":"The method relies on a support vector machine as a black-box classifier and does not provide any per-decision explanations, feature‐importance analysis, decision paths, or post-hoc XAI techniques. There is no mechanism exposed for users or auditors to understand why a specific webpage is flagged.","evidence":"– Section 4.15 (page 6): “We apply support vector machine (SVM) … to classify webpages features.”  \n– Algorithm in Fig. 2 (page 2): “Finally the SVM Classifier would determine the phishing label from the generated feature vectors.”  \n(No mention of any interpretability or explanation module.)"}
