    "why": "The paper satisfies both criteria for a 'High' rating. First, the proposed method is designed to address concept drift by using an enhanced blacklist filter to detect near-duplicate and replica phishing sites. This filter employs fuzzy hashing (Simhash and Perceptual hash) on structural and visual content, which provides inherent resilience to minor modifications and reuse of phishing kits—a common form of attack evolution. This is more stable than relying solely on volatile lexical features. Second, and crucially, the evaluation methodology explicitly validates this approach using a temporal data split. The system's blacklist is generated using data from an earlier time period, and its detection performance is tested against a dataset of phishing sites collected from a later, distinct time period. This evaluation protocol directly assesses the model's ability to generalize and remain effective against future, unseen attacks, which is the core requirement for addressing concept drift.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section 3.1.2 Blacklist database generation—replica detection, 'We have collected phishing sites at different time periods for the generation of blacklist database and for the replica detection. The dataset used for blacklist database generation was collected during April 2018–October 2018 and the dataset for replica detection was collected during December 2018–February 2019. The main intention to choose the data-set at different time slots is to illustrate that phishing sites gets repeated with replica or manipulated content over time.'"
