    "why": "The paper evaluates its method using a public dataset [27] containing 58,000 legitimate websites. However, the paper provides no information about the source or characteristics of these benign URLs. There is no discussion or analysis to confirm the inclusion of either (i) low-reputation or long-tail domains (such as newly registered sites, personal blogs, or small business pages) or (ii) benign pages that make legitimate use of third-party brand elements (like social media login widgets or payment buttons). The evaluation relies entirely on the provided dataset without characterizing its diversity, thus failing to demonstrate robustness against common sources of false positives.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.1, Dataset: \"In our work, a public dataset has been evaluated with a deep investigation to conclude whether it is proper to forecast future phishing attacks or not. All of the characteristics are gathered from Phishing Websites Dataset, which was published in 2020 [27]. The dataset has 88,647 instances with 111 features and a labeled output column. According to Fig. 3, the number of non-phishing instances (0) is 58,000, and the number of phishing ones (1) is 30,647.\" The paper does not provide any further details on the collection methodology or diversity of these 58,000 benign instances."
