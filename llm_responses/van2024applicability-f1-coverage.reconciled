{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not consider or evaluate the broad range of real‐world phishing tactics defined in the codebook (e.g. homograph attacks, compromised domains, IP URLs, lexical manipulation). It uses a generic phishing dataset with no annotation or breakdown by tactic, and it reports only overall detection performance without any per‐tactic analysis or quantitative dataset characterization by tactic. Thus it ignores tactic diversity.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 5.1 Dataset: “The phishing websites come from PhishTank (PhishTank 2022), OpenPhish (OpenPhish 2022) and PhishRepo (Ariyadasa et al. 2022).” (no information on the diversity of phishing tactics in the dataset)"}
