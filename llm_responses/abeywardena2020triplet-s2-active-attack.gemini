    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper proposes a screenshot-based detection method, which is inherently resilient to a specific subset of active attacks, namely code-level obfuscation. The authors explicitly claim this as a key advantage, stating their method is resilient to attacks that modify underlying HTML, CSS, or JavaScript without significantly altering the visual rendering. This constitutes a defense against one class of active attacks. However, the paper does not evaluate its robustness against other relevant active attacks within its modality. For example, it does not address dynamic evasions like cloaking (serving benign content to the crawler) or deferred content loading (where phishing elements appear only after user interaction), which its static screenshot acquisition method is vulnerable to. Furthermore, there is no consideration of adversarial visual attacks (subtle image perturbations) designed to fool the CNN. Because the method demonstrates resilience to one type of attack but does not evaluate or address others relevant to its scope, it meets the criteria for 'Medium'.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"Since our method does not rely on text and code features, it is resilient to code obfuscation.\"\nPage 2, Section III, Data Collection: \"We set a page load timeout of 60 seconds; after completion of a page load, we waited five seconds before taking a screenshot.\" - This static capture method is vulnerable to dynamic attacks like deferred execution or cloaking, which are not discussed or evaluated.\nPage 3-4, Sections IV-D, V: The evaluation is conducted on standard phishing and benign datasets without any mention of testing against actively manipulated or evasive samples, such as those employing cloaking, dynamic content, or adversarial visual perturbations."
