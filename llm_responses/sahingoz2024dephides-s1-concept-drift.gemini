    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's methodology is designed to be adaptive to new threats. The authors explicitly state the model can be updated iteratively with new data without requiring a full retrain, which is a key strategy for addressing concept drift. The use of character-level embeddings over handcrafted lexical features also aims to create a more robust model against simple changes in attacker tactics. However, the evaluation protocol does not validate this adaptive capability with a temporal split. The dataset, while collected over a long period, is split randomly into training and testing sets (70%/10%). A stronger evaluation would have involved training on older data and testing on newer data to prove resilience to evolving threats. Because the method incorporates an adaptive strategy but lacks the corresponding temporal evaluation, it meets the criteria for a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section V: \"It is not necessary to retrain the entire dataset when incorporating new data. The model can be updated iteratively, continuing from where it left off in the previous training.\"\n\nPage 9, Section IV: \"To ensure the detection of the latest attacks and address the limitations of supervised learning, the iterative updating of the model with newly acquired training data proves highly beneficial.\"\n\nPage 8, Section IV: \"The dataset is divided into three parts for making a comparable performance measurement. 70 % is used for training, while 20 % is for validation and 10 % is used for testing.\" [This describes a standard random split, not a temporal evaluation protocol.]"
