{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishFencing deliberately avoids highly volatile URL and content features by relying on more stable visual (logo) and network (IP/AS/geolocation) signals, and even includes an autonomous mechanism to refresh logo fingerprints. However, its evaluation is conducted over a single recent dataset without any temporal train–test split or time-forward deployment simulation to assess resilience against evolving phishing tactics.","evidence":"Section 3.1 (page 5): “Features used in PhishFencing… URLs and content of webpages… are not stable enough… Features used in PhishFencing are listed in Table 1… visual and network identity features.”; Section 5.1 (page 11): “The groundtruth dataset has been collected for 7 days continuously… we demonstrate the superior performance of PhishFencing.” No temporal split or future-period testing is described.
