{"value":"Medium","why":"While SHLR demonstrates robustness against a variety of URL‐level obfuscation tactics (e.g. hidden brand words, IP‐as‐domain, protocol injections) and simple static HTML evasions (meta‐refresh, anomalous <a> and <link> tags), it does not evaluate or defend against many other active attacks observable in its input modality—such as obfuscated or Base64‐encoded JavaScript, junk/invisible HTML elements, image‐based text, dynamic/AJAX content loading, deferred execution, or cloaking. Thus it meets only a subset of the active‐attack resilience criteria.","evidence":"Page 263 §3.2 (‘Pattern matching through strings can detect URL obfuscation techniques… We propose Rules 1–7’ – exclusively URL string checks)\nPage 264 §3.3.2 (‘HTML features: meta‐refresh and <a>/<link> tag anomalies…’ – no JavaScript or dynamic content defenses)"}
