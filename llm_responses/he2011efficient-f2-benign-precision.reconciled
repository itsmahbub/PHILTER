{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation uses only high-reputation, popular domains (top-targeted sites, Alexa top sites, and previously studied pages) and does not include any low-reputation or long-tail domains, nor does it include benign pages embedding common brand elements (e.g., PayPal widgets, third-party login buttons) in its testing datasets. Thus it fails both diversity criteria and merits a “Low” rating.","evidence":"Section 5.1 (page 12024): “We collected 100 login pages of top targeted legitimate websites…35 Homepages of top targeted websites…35 Top pages according to Alexa…30 Random pages from a list of 500 pages used in 3Sharp’s phishing study.” No mention of low-reputation domains or benign brand-element pages."}
