{"value":"Medium","why":"While the paper does not include an adversarial or evasion‐focused evaluation (ruling out “High”), it explicitly incorporates defenses against common URL‐level manipulations within its claimed scope. The use of BERT to handle obfuscated or incomplete URL text constitutes a defense against lexical evasion, and the GNN’s graph‐based URL representation targets structural evasion tactics (e.g. deceptive subdomains). These design choices satisfy the codebook’s criterion for “Medium.”","evidence":"Page 7, Section VII.A (“…even with incomplete or obfuscated URL text, improving its ability to identify phishing attempts…”) and Section VII.B (“Phishing URLs often employ deceptive structural features… The GNN processes the graph representation of URLs to identify structural anomalies…”)"}
