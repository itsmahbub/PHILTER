{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates detection only on naturally occurring phishing and legitimate URLs from PhishTank and Alexa without testing any deliberate evasion or adversarial manipulations (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, dynamic content loading or cloaking). There is no experimental assessment of robustness against active attacks, and the authors even note in their limitations that their method fails on embedded objects such as JavaScript or Flash.","evidence":"Section 7 Limitations (page 20): “It also fails to detect phishing sites containing embedded objects such as javascript, flash and HTML files. Attackers use embedded objects to replace the textual content of a website to bypass the anti-phishing techniques.”"}
