{
  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper’s evaluation includes class-specific error rates (missing alarm rate and false alarm rate) alongside overall accuracy, but does not report precision, recall, or F1-score, nor any summary metric such as AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, or MCC. Thus it covers some relevant class-sensitive metrics but lacks the full set required for a high-quality, imbalance-aware evaluation.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 4.2: “we use accuracy rate, missing rate, and false alarm rate as performance metrics….”; Table 3 (Page 8) reports only accuracy, missing alarm rate, and false alarm rate."
