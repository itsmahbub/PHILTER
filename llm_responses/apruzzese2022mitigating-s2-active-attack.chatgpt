{"value":"High","why":"The Protective Operation Chain (POC) algorithm is shown to withstand a wide variety of active evasion attacks on URL-, HTML- and reputation-based features (simple URL shortening, HTML link injection, plus seven gray-box feature-perturbation scenarios) across four benchmarks and 13 classifiers, while preserving baseline performance. This meets the criterion of robustness against a diverse set of active attacks within its input modality.","evidence":"(1) Page 9, Section 6.4: “Table 8 consists mostly of bold entries, showing that POC is more resilient than past work for almost all combinations of dataset and classifier used.”  \n(2) Page 9–10, Section 6.4: “We see that most entries in the table are in boldface, suggesting that POC is more resilient to the GBA-Δ attack irrespective of the dataset and classifier used.”"}
