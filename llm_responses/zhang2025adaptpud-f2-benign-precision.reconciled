{"value":"Low","why":"The benign dataset is drawn only from Alexa (high-reputation/popular) and Curlie, with no explicit inclusion or analysis of low-reputation/long-tail domains or pages containing legitimate brand elements (e.g., OAuth widgets, embedded logos). Thus, it fails to satisfy either diversity subset required for a Medium or High rating.","evidence":"Section 5.1.1 (“Dataset”), pages 7–8: “P-URLs … and B-URLs … are sourced from Alexa and Curlie.” No mention of low-reputation/long-tail domains or brand-element pages."}
