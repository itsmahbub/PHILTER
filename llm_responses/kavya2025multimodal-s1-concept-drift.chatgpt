{"value":"High","why":"The proposed framework employs adaptive strategies to handle concept drift—specifically, the TGNN-Att and MMTHF-Net models incorporate temporal graph networks with attention and LSTM layers to capture evolving phishing behaviors—and the evaluation protocol measures performance across distinct time windows, demonstrating resilience to temporal shifts.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “TGNN-Att addresses temporal variations in phishing behavior by using attention-enhanced temporal graph networks and LSTMs…”; Page 14, Section IV: “Table 4 and figure 5 evaluates the temporal adaptability of TGNN-Att model across 4 timestamp windows within a 24-hour period. The accuracy of TGNN-Att remains consistently above 91.8%, peaking at 93.2% between 6-12 hours.”"}
