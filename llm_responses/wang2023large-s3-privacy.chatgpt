{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any privacy‐preserving deployment or inference mechanism. All discussion focuses on server‐side pre‐training and fine‐tuning of PhishBERT, with no mention of client‐side inference, URL truncation/sanitization, hashed lookups, federated learning, or anonymized feature extraction. By the provided criteria, this absence of any inference‐time privacy safeguards categorizes the method as Low.","evidence":"Across the entire paper (e.g., Sections 2–4), there is no discussion of deployment or inference-time data handling; no mention of running detection locally on client devices or of any URL sanitization or hashing (Pages 1–5)."}
