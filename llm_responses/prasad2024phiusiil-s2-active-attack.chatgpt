{"value":"Medium","why":"The PhiUSIIL framework explicitly evaluates and defends against a subset of active evasion techniques observable in URLs—specifically visual similarity–based attacks such as zero-width characters, homograph, punycode, homophone, bit-squatting, and combosquatting—via its URL Similarity Index. However, it does not evaluate or defend against other active evasions within its input modality and scope (e.g., obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, dynamic content loading, deferred execution, or cloaking), nor does it assess adversarial perturbations via API calls or interactive analysis. This partial coverage of the attack surface corresponds to “Medium” resilience under the codebook.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “The similarity index helps effectively identify visual similarity-based attacks such as zero-width characters, homograph, punycode, homophone, bit squatting, and combosquatting attacks.”  \nPage 7, Section 4.1: “Phishing URLs generally mimic legitimate URLs … The proposed URL similarity index approach identifies such tricks by calculating USI for a URL.”  \n(No evaluation is provided for dynamic or scripting-level evasions such as obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, or deferred execution.)"}
