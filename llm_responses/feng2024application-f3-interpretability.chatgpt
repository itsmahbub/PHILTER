{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method is a black‐box neural network with Monte Carlo training and design risk minimization, but the paper does not include any mechanism—neither inherently interpretable model structures nor post hoc explanation techniques—for explaining individual or global classification decisions.","evidence":"Page 1869, Section 3.2: The paper describes only the neural network structure and training (‘…this novel neural network is different from the traditional neural network that introduces the principle of design risk minimization and Monte Carlo algorithm…’) without any mention of feature importance, decision paths, or XAI methods."}
