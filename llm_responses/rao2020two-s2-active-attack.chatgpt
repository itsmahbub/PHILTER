{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not evaluate the proposed method against any active evasion techniques (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, cloaking or dynamic content loading). All experiments use unmodified phishing pages from PhishTank and benign pages from Google searches, with no adversarial or evasive manipulations introduced.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (Dataset): “Phishing sites are collected from Phishtank … legitimate sites … from Google search results.” No further experiments against obfuscation or dynamic evasions are described."}
