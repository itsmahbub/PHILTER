    "why": "The paper demonstrates resistance against a specific subset of active attacks relevant to its input modality. The method is explicitly designed to counter two modern evasion techniques: URL shortening (TinyURLs) and Browser-in-the-Browser (BiTB) attacks. It handles TinyURLs by having a browser extension resolve the original URL before analysis. It addresses BiTB by not just analyzing the main URL, but by scraping the full page content (HTML/JavaScript) within a sandboxed environment to find and classify all embedded URLs, including those hidden in `<iframe>` elements. This shows a clear methodological consideration for structural and redirection-based evasions. However, the paper does not evaluate its resilience against a wider range of active attacks. There is no discussion or testing against dynamic content loading (e.g., where phishing elements are loaded via AJAX after user interaction), cloaking (where the server presents benign content to the Docker-based crawler), or adversarial URLs specifically crafted to mislead the BiLSTM classifier. Therefore, it is robust against a subset of attacks but does not cover the full attack surface.",
    "evidence": "Page 3, Section 1: \"The proposed model detects three types of phishing attacks: Regular URL-based attacks, Browser in Browser attacks (BiTB), and TinyURL attacks.\"\nPage 4, Section 3.1.1: \"Once a user clicks on a URL, the extension extracts the original webpage's URL. This step protects the user from TinyURL attacks.\"\nPage 5, Section 3.2: \"Since the BiTB attacks use IFrame, we propose scrapping all URLs inside the webpage. So, we use three methods to scrape all URLs inside the webpage: Frame source such as (Frame, Inline Frame (IFrame), JFrame), href attribute, and URL regular expression.\"\nPage 5, Section 3.2: \"First, open the suspect webpage and scrape all its HTML and JavaScript contents.\" - This describes a static scrape, with no mention of dynamic interaction to uncover deferred phishing content."
