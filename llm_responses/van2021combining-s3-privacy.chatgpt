{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method transmits sensitive data — namely raw textual features (e.g., page title or DOM text) and actual screenshot regions of the visited page — to external search engines (Google) for both text-based and reverse image search, without any privacy-preserving transformations or on-device inference. There is no mention of hashing, truncation, sanitization of URLs or federated learning. Consequently, full page content is sent off-device for classification.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.1: “Textual features are used as search terms in a text-based search engine (e.g., Google …), whereas the portions of the screenshot identified as regions of interest are fed to a reverse image search engine.”"}
