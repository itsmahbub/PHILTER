{"value":"Low","why":"The paper provides no explicit description of a privacy-preserving deployment architecture (e.g. client-side inference or hashed lookups). It neither states that detection runs entirely on the user’s device nor that only anonymized features are shared; in fact one of its key NLP features (“Alexa Check”) would require consulting an external popularity list at inference time. Under the codebook, absence of any inference-time data-handling details and reliance on full URLs without mention of on-device processing or data sanitization mandates a “Low” rating.","evidence":"Page 349–350, Table 2 “NLP based features”: includes “Alexa Check (2)…Is the domain in Alexa Top one million list?”\nPage 351, Section 6 “Advantages of the proposed approach,” under “Independence from Third-Party Services,” the authors note they avoid third-party lookups for real-time performance, but do not specify how Alexa checks or full URL analysis occur without off-device queries."}
