    "why": "The paper's primary contribution and experimental focus are on improving dataset realism by using legitimate login URLs instead of homepages, and on analyzing the temporal decay of model performance. The evaluation is a standard classification task on static datasets. The methodology is not evaluated against any form of active or adversarial attack. Although the phishing URLs are sourced from real-world feeds (Phishtank) and likely contain evasive characteristics, the study does not design experiments to test the model's resilience to these specific techniques (e.g., lexical obfuscation, adversarial perturbations). The benchmark is limited to classifying a static collection of phishing vs. benign URLs without any adversarial or evasive manipulation being introduced or tested as part of the evaluation protocol.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"In most current state-of-the-art solutions dealing with phishing detection, the legitimate class is made up of homepages without including login forms. On the contrary, we use URLs from the login page in both classes because we consider it is much more representative of a real case scenario... Additionally, we use datasets from different years to show how models decrease their accuracy over time by training a base model with old datasets and testing it with recent URLs.\" This quote establishes that the paper's core research questions are about dataset representativeness and model aging, not active attack resistance.\n\nPage 7, Section V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS: The experimental setup described involves training and testing on five different static datasets (PWD2016, 1M-PD, Ebbu2017, PIU-60K, PLU-60K) using standard metrics like accuracy and F1-score. There is no mention of a methodology for generating or testing against actively manipulated or evasive URLs."
