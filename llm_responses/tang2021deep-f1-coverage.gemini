    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a deep learning model that operates solely on the character sequence of a URL. This approach is inherently tactic-agnostic, as it does not rely on hand-crafted rules for specific attack types. However, the authors completely ignore the concept of tactic diversity in their methodology and evaluation. The paper does not discuss which phishing tactics (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, lexical variations) their model might be effective against. Most importantly, the evaluation datasets (Phish Storm, Phish Tank, ISCX, Kaggle) are described only by their sources and the number of legitimate/phishing samples. There is no analysis or breakdown of the phishing URLs by the tactics they employ, and consequently, no per-tactic performance is reported. The evaluation is limited to aggregate metrics like accuracy and F1-score, which provides no insight into the model's robustness against a varied threat landscape. This lack of consideration for tactic diversity in both the dataset description and the experimental results places the paper in the 'Low' category.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section III.B.3, 'FEATURE EXTRACTION': The method is described as treating a URL as a sequence of characters, converting it into a matrix based on a dictionary of 100 ASCII characters. Quote: 'In deep learning models, the tokenization process parses a URL string to a list of characters (Character-level tokens)... Therefore, each URL can be transformed into a 200*100 matrix.' This confirms the model operates on the raw URL string without explicit feature engineering for specific tactics.\nPage 4, Section III.A, 'DATA COLLECTION TASKS': The datasets are presented in Table 1, showing only the source and the number of legitimate and phishing URLs. No information about the types of phishing attacks within these datasets is provided. Quote: 'We collected data from different open sources shown in Table 1. The Phish Storm [2] dataset contains 96,018 URLs: 48,009 legitimate URLs and 48,009 phishing URLs.'\nPage 9, Section V.A, 'GRU WITH DIFFERENT DATASETS': The evaluation section (including Table 3) presents aggregate performance metrics (accuracy, F1, false positive rate, etc.) for the model on different datasets. There is no breakdown of these results based on phishing tactics. The discussion focuses on performance variation with dataset size and source, not attack type. Quote: 'Table 3 shows the core performance indicators of the GRU model with 8 datasets. The ISCX dataset obtained the highest accuracy.'"
