{"value":"Medium","why":"Although the method does not include any adaptive retraining or concept‐drift–aware feature engineering, the authors explicitly evaluate the model’s performance in a time‐forward setting. They train the CNN‐LSTM on a large historical phishing dataset (2014–2018) and then test it on a separate set of currently live phishing URLs, noting a drop in accuracy due to evolving phishing characteristics. This temporal split satisfies the criterion for a “Medium” rating.","evidence":"Page 9, Section V-A: “First, historical data confirmed as phishing from 2014 to 2018 were crawled… To solve this problem, we build the dataset DATA1 by extracting the currently surviving 22 445 URLs… The remaining data in DATA are built into the dataset DATA2…”\nPage 11, right column: “However, the effect is worse than the 5-fold cross-validation of the CNN-LSTM algorithm on DATA2… Phishing website URLs have different characteristics in different periods due to the different target websites they imitate.”"}
