    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation is entirely based on a dataset synthetically generated from a list of 30 highly popular, well-known brands. The method is designed to detect typosquatting variations of these specific brands. There is no consideration or inclusion of a benign dataset composed of actual webpages. The evaluation does not test the model against low-reputation domains, long-tail websites, or legitimate pages that might use brand elements (like payment logos or social media widgets). The \"benign\" or \"genuine\" cases in this study are simply the correctly spelled brand names themselves, which represent the highest possible reputation and are the opposite of the diverse, challenging benign cases required by the metric. Consequently, the evaluation provides no insight into the model's potential false positive rate on real-world benign sites.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section V, RESULTS: \"For this experiment, the thirty brands identified as the most present in the Brazilian phishing scenario [19] were selected. For this selection, 57,356 occurrences were collected, registered on the popular platform that maintains blocking lists, Phishtank, in the year 2020.\" \n\nPage 4, Section III.A, Construction of the database: \"...it was proposed to build an application capable of elaborating distorted terms (typosquatting) referring to the selected brands. such as \"amoz0n\", \"ltau\", \"yah00\". In this process, ten characteristics already observed and discussed in the literature [19] were applied... giving rise to a labeled database, composed of 33,077 distorted terms.\"\n\nPage 5, Section III.D, Page rank: \"Analyzing the distances obtained by MDB, it is observed that the distance between the true mark and an identical term is equal to zero, while the distance between the true term and similar marks (typosquatting) varies between values greater than zero and less than 0.5.\" This confirms that the baseline for a \"genuine\" page is a perfect match with a major brand, not a sample from a diverse set of benign websites."
