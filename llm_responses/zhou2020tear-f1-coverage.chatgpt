{"value":"Low","why":"PhishFencing is a target‐dependent, brand‐spoofing detector that only handles visual logo matching and basic HTTP/HTTPS hosting differences for eight major brands. It does not address or evaluate other real‐world phishing tactics (e.g. subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, IP‐as‐URL, lexical manipulations, shared/compromised hosting, internal‐portal mimicry), nor does it provide any per‐tactic performance breakdown.","evidence":"Section 5.1 (page 11): “we followed SquatPhish … to select 8 most frequently targeted brands”; Section 4.3 (page 9): matching step is solely “sub-graph matching … between unknown page screenshots and logo images”; no discussion or breakdown of additional tactics is provided."}
