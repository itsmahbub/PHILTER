    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The system is evaluated using several inherently interpretable models, including Decision Tree and Random Forest, with the latter being the best-performing model. While the paper does not provide per-decision explanations (e.g., tracing a specific URL's path through a decision tree) or use post-hoc XAI techniques like SHAP or LIME, the chosen models are not pure black boxes. They allow for global or limited insight, for instance, by analyzing feature importances from the Random Forest model to understand which URL characteristics are generally most influential. Furthermore, the authors designed a set of 40 human-understandable \"NLP based features\" (e.g., keyword counts, presence of special characters), which provides a degree of transparency into the signals the model uses for classification. This use of interpretable models and features, without providing per-decision traceability, aligns with the 'Medium' criteria.",
    "evidence": "Page 352, Section 5.1: \"In this paper, we have used seven different classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, kNN (n=3), Adaboost, K-star, SMO and Decision Tree) as machine learning mechanism of the proposed system and then compared their performances.\"\nPage 353, Section 5.2: \"Therefore, in addition to some features, which are proposed in the previous literature, we defined some additional features for detection of phishing websites. There are totally 40 different NLP based features, which are listed in Table 2.\"\nPage 354, Table 2: The table lists explicit, understandable features such as \"Keyword Count\", \"Brand Name Count\", \"Puny Code\", and \"Special Character (8)\"."
