{"value":"Medium","why":"VisualPhishNet is tactic-agnostic by design and evaluates robustness against a variety of visual perturbations, but the authors do not map their evaluation to real-world phishing tactic categories (e.g. subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, compromised hosts) nor report detection performance broken out per tactic. They report only overall matching accuracy and ROC curves, and breakdowns across perturbation types rather than across phishing tactics.","evidence":"Throughout Sections 6.7–6.8 (pp. 8–10), the paper evaluates performance against hand-crafted image perturbations and adversarial noise, and on zero-day pages, but provides no per-tactic dataset breakdown or per-tactic detection results as required for a “High” rating under the Tactic Diversity Coverage metric."}
