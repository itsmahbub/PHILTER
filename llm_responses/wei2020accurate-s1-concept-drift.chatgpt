{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed system includes an adaptive strategy—daily monitoring of PhishTank and retraining the model whenever new phishing URLs are available (i.e., continual learning)—but the evaluation is carried out via random 5-fold cross-validation on a static dataset rather than using temporally disjoint training and test sets. Thus it meets only one of the temporal‐robustness criteria.","evidence":"Fig. 7 (page 6, Sequence Diagram): “Every day the system monitors if there are new phishing addresses in the PhishTank repository and trains the model with a new, larger dataset.”; Section 5 (page 6): “The dataset described in Section 4.1 was divided into 80% training set and 20% testing set and 5-fold cross-validation was applied.”"}
