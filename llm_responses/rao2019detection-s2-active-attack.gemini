    "why": "The paper demonstrates robustness against a subset of active attacks relevant to its modality (URL and HTML source code analysis). The method explicitly designs a feature (HF7) to counter a significant evasion technique known as \"Image-based Phishing,\" where attackers replace textual content with a background image to bypass text-based detectors. It also incorporates features to detect simple URL obfuscation (UF1-UF4) and common link manipulation patterns used by attackers (HF3-HF6, HF8). However, the paper acknowledges in its limitations that the method is not resilient to more advanced evasions. Specifically, it fails to handle phishing pages that use embedded objects like obfuscated JavaScript, Flash, or dynamic HTML files to hide malicious content. As the analysis is static (downloading the initial source code), it is also implicitly vulnerable to dynamic content loading or deferred execution.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 3.1.3, Point 7: \"HF7-Presence of anchor links in HTML body: This feature checks for the presence of anchor links in the body section of source code of a website. If absent, then the feature is set to 1 else it is set to 0. The rationale behind this feature is that there exists at least one anchor link such as signin, signup, forgot password or others in legitimate site’s login page whereas in phishing websites, attackers replace entire legitimate site content with a single background image. We termed these kinds of phishing sites as Imagebased Phishing.\"\n\nPage 21, Section 7, \"Limitations\": \"It also fails to detect phishing sites containing embedded objects such as javascript, flash and HTML files. Attackers use embedded objects to replace the textual content of a website to bypass the anti-phishing techniques.\""
