{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates its phishing detection models only on a standard, clean phishing website dataset using static URL/HTML/JS features and 10-fold cross-validation. It does not test or demonstrate any robustness against deliberate evasive or adversarial manipulations (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, cloaking, deferred execution) within its claimed input modality.","evidence":"Section III.A (page 142535): “The phishing website dataset contains 11,055 instances, 30 independent features, and one (1) class attribute…” Section IV.A (page 142538): “All proposed AI meta-learner models … were developed having conducted the experiments on … the phishing website dataset.” No active‐attack or evasion testing is described."}
