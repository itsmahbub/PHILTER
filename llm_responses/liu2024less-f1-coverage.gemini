    "why": "The paper demonstrates a strong focus on tactic diversity throughout its design and evaluation. The core contribution—eliminating a predefined reference list—is aimed at covering a wider variety of brand targets, including less-popular ones. The methodology explicitly describes mechanisms to handle specific, common phishing tactics such as the use of web hosting services (e.g., GitHub, Vercel), SSO domain redirection, and legitimate domain aliases. The evaluation is comprehensive and provides quantitative performance breakdowns for several of these tactics. For example, it reports a 0% false positive rate on a dedicated domain alias dataset, a 70% brand recognition rate on low-ranked (less popular) brands, and measures robustness against various synthetic evasion attacks like HTML obfuscation and prompt injection. Furthermore, the paper provides a detailed quantitative breakdown of its failure cases from a large-scale field study, categorizing them by the underlying phishing tactic (e.g., 53% cryptocurrency phishing, 15% cloaking), which underscores a thorough, tactic-aware analysis.",
