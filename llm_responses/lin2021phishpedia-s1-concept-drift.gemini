    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper's method, Phishpedia, is explicitly designed to be resilient to concept drift by relying on inherently stable features—visual brand identity (logos)—instead of volatile features like URLs or HTML content that are common targets of attacker evolution. The abstract states that the method \"does not require training on any phishing samples,\" which fundamentally sidesteps the problem of model degradation due to evolving phishing tactics in training data. The architecture is also adaptive by design; the Siamese network for brand recognition allows new brands to be added to the target list without retraining the entire model, a feature validated in the generalization experiment (RQ3).\n\nThe evaluation protocol strongly supports the claim of robustness over time. The paper includes a 30-day \"in the wild\" phishing discovery experiment where the system is prospectively deployed to scan newly emerging domains from CertStream. This constitutes a time-forward evaluation, testing the pre-trained model against future, unseen phishing attacks as they appear in real-time, directly fulfilling the metric's requirement for evaluation on data from different time periods.",
    "evidence": "Page 2, Abstract: \"And very importantly, different from common approaches, Phishpedia does not require training on any phishing samples.\"\n\nPage 11, Section 5.4: \"In this experiment, we evaluate whether our Siamese model is generalizable when new logos (not used in training) are added to target brand list. ... Among the 7,411 webpages covered by 51 “new” brands, Phishpedia recognized 87.46% phishing webpages with high identification rate of 99.91%. It indicates that the Siamese model well captures generalizable features extracted from logo samples. Thus, our approach is generalizable for adding new logos in the target brand list during runtime.\"\n\nPage 13, Section 6.2 Phishing discovery experiment: \"We apply Phishpedia to scan and identify phishing webpages from the reported emerging domains every day. ... We ran all the solutions for 30 days (from Sep, 10 to Oct 9, 2020). During the experiments, we record the landing URL and screenshot of each URL for postmortem analyses.\""
