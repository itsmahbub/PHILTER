{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation dataset is drawn solely from the Alexa Top 10K list (i.e., popular, high-reputation domains) and does not include any low-reputation/long-tail sites or benign pages featuring legitimate brand elements (e.g., embedded PayPal/OAuth widgets or social media buttons). Thus, the evaluation lacks the two harder benign subsets required for higher diversity.","evidence":"Page 2, Section III (Data Collection): “We build a dataset from the Top 10k domains of the Alexa list of 2019-01-25. The rationale is that phishers usually target popular sites.” No mention is made of including low-reputation domains or pages with legitimate brand elements."}
