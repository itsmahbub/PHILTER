{"value":"Low","why":"The authors’ evaluation of benign pages is limited to high-reputation, top-ranked domains and does not include either low-reputation/long-tail domains or benign pages using embedded brand elements (e.g., OAuth widgets or logos).","evidence":"Page 4, Section 4: “we constructed a legitimate test set of 683 benign examples from the top-ranked websites’ pages that we crawled (with domains different from the trusted-list); we selected 3–7 screenshots from each website.” No mention is made of low-reputation domains or brand-element usage in the benign set."}
