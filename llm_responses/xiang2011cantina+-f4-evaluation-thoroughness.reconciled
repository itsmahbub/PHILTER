{"value":"Medium","why":"While the paper reports class‐sensitive metrics (true positive rate as recall and F1‐score) and uses a summary metric (AUC‐ROC), it does not explicitly report precision. The false positive rate is not a substitute for precision, so the evaluation lacks full coverage of the required class‐sensitive metrics (precision, recall, F1).","evidence":"Section 7.1 (Evaluation Metrics): “we adopted true positive rate and false positive rate … We also used the F1 measure … we adopted … area under the ROC curve (AUC).”; Table IV: reports TP (%), FP (%) and F1, but no precision column."}
