{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed KnowPhish + KPD method is tactic-agnostic by design and explicitly addresses multiple evasion tactics—logo variants (T1), text-only brand presentations (T2), and HTML-based obfuscations (T3)—across both image and text modalities. However, while the authors conduct extensive end-to-end evaluations on TR-OP and SG-SCAN, they do not provide a quantitative breakdown of their evaluation datasets by tactic nor report detection performance separately for each tactic category.","evidence":"Page 5, Section “Evasion Attacks” (‘T1: Phishing with Logo Variants… T2: Phishing with Text Brands… T3: HTML-oriented Attacks’) and Page 10, Section 6 (Table 2: overall metrics only, no per-tactic performance breakdown)"}
