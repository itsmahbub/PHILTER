    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's methodology and evaluation are exclusively focused on predictive performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and runtime. The authors train and compare several machine learning models, including complex ones like XGBoost, treating them as black boxes. There is no mention or application of any interpretability techniques, such as SHAP, LIME, or even a discussion of global feature importance, to explain the model's decisions. The analysis is limited to model performance, not model transparency or the reasoning behind individual predictions.",
    "evidence": "The paper's evaluation section (4. Experiments and results) is entirely dedicated to performance metrics. The primary results are presented in tables showing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and confusion matrix counts. The selection of the best model is based purely on these performance indicators. The conclusion summarizes this focus: \"...the XGBoost classifier outperformed the other classifiers in the classification of phishing websites, with 99.1% precision, 99.4% recall, 99.2% F1 score, 99.1% specificity, and 99.22% overall accuracy rate.\" (Page 16, Section 5). The paper does not contain any discussion or implementation of methods to interpret or explain the classification outputs."
