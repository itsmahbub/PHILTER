    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify URLs based on their character-level representation. CNNs are inherently complex and non-interpretable models, often referred to as \"black boxes.\" The paper provides no mechanism to explain or audit the model's predictions. The entire focus of the methodology and evaluation is on performance metrics such as accuracy, speed, and memory consumption. There is no mention or application of any post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (like SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, or attention mechanisms) to provide per-decision reasoning, nor is there an analysis of global feature importance to understand which lexical patterns the model has learned to associate with phishing. The system outputs a classification without any accompanying justification.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section 4.3, 'Convolutional neural network': The paper describes the model as a standard CNN architecture: \"We analyze URLs using convolutional neural networks (CNN) [34]... The one-hot character-level representation of URLs is rather sparse. To improve the performance of the convolutional layers we applied an embedding layer at the network input... Then, there are standard CNN layers, and the last layer is a fully connected layer with two outputs (legitimate/phishing URL).\" This describes a typical deep learning pipeline without any built-in interpretability.\n\nPage 5, Section 5, 'Experiments': The evaluation section focuses exclusively on quantitative performance metrics. The paper compares the proposed CNN to an LSTM network on measures like GPU memory, parameter size, speed (Table 4), accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score (Table 5). There is no qualitative analysis or attempt to interpret the model's decision-making process.\n\nPage 7, Section 6, 'Conclusion': The conclusion summarizes the achievements in terms of performance: \"We showed that the URL dictionaryless analysis provides nearly 100% accurate security. Accurate, URL-based detection provides zero-day defence... The trained phishing detector is small and fast and can be used effortlessly on mobile devices.\" The paper does not claim or discuss interpretability as a feature or a goal of the research."
