{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishIntention includes targeted evaluations showing that its vision-based analyses are resilient to HTML obfuscation (e.g., squatting “login”→“l0gin”, URL renaming) and to gradient-based adversarial perturbations, and it handles deferred execution via dynamic interaction. However, it does not evaluate other active evasions—such as cloaking to serve benign pages to crawlers, invisible elements or junk-HTML injections—within its screenshot-and-interaction modality.","evidence":"Section 9.2 (pp. 13): Table 6 ‘Robustness Against HTML Obfuscation’; Section 9.2 (pp. 13): ‘our experimental results show that all models … are robust against I-FGSM, I-StepLL, C&W L2, DeepFool, and DAG.’"}
