    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation suitable for class imbalance. It reports key class-sensitive metrics including F1-score, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate, while also providing the explicit formulas for precision and recall. Furthermore, it includes a robust summary metric, Mean Average Precision (mAP), which evaluates the precision-recall trade-off similarly to AUC-PRC, making it a suitable measure for overall classification quality in this context. The combination of these metrics ensures a thorough and meaningful assessment of the model's performance.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section V, EVALUATION RESULTS: \"Therefore, we use accuracy, F1, false-positive rate, false-negative rate to measure the efficiency of models. The mathematical formulas for these metrics are as Equations (4), (7), (8), and (9).\" and \"Furthermore, Average precision (AP) is a widely used metric in evaluating the accuracy of deep learning models by computing the average precision value for recall value over 0 to 1; higher is better. Mean average precision (mAP) is the average of AP. Equation (10) shows the calculation logic.\" \nPage 9, Table 3: This table presents the evaluation results for the GRU model across different datasets, with columns for 'accuracy', 'F1', 'False-positive rate', 'False-negative rate', and 'mAP'.\nPage 10, Table 4: This table compares the performance of different classifiers, including columns for 'accuracy', 'F1', 'False-positive rate', and 'False-negative rate'."
