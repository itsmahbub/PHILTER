{"value":"Medium","why":"The authors’ evaluation uses 10,604 “random unique URLs from the Common Crawl database,” which likely includes low-reputation or long-tail domains, but there is no mention of selecting pages that legitimately embed brand elements (e.g. PayPal widgets or social media buttons). Thus, only one of the two required diverse benign subsets is explicitly addressed.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (Phishing dataset): “we downloaded 10,604 random unique URLs from the Common Crawl database” and “initial experiments with Moz Top 500 and Alexa … caused a strong bias towards short, top-domain URLs, so we instead sample from Common Crawl.” No part of the paper describes inclusion of pages with legitimate brand element usage."}
