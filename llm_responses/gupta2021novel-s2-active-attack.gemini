    "why": "The paper's evaluation is conducted on a static, pre-existing dataset (ISCXURL-2016) using a standard train-test split methodology. The proposed method relies exclusively on nine lexical features of the URL string, a modality that is inherently vulnerable to active attacks like URL obfuscation (e.g., manipulating delimiters, path length, or token counts to appear more benign). However, the paper provides no evidence of testing its model against such deliberate, evasive manipulations. The evaluation is confined to classifying phishing vs. benign examples as they appear in the dataset, without considering adversarial scenarios. The claim of detecting \"new websites\" refers to the standard generalization capability of a machine learning model on unseen data, not a demonstrated resilience to active attacks designed to fool the classifier.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.3, 'Dataset and its pre-processing': \"To evaluate our proposed approach, we have used a dataset 'ISCXURL-2016' from the data repository of the University of Canada Brunswick. It contains spam records, phishing links, malware, defacements, and benign URLs [39]. We have extracted 10000 benign and 9964 phishing URLs from the repository... Once the dataset gets standardized, it is then split into the training set and testing set. The training set data contains 15971 instances, whereas the testing set contains 3993 instances.\" This section confirms the use of a static dataset and a standard evaluation protocol, with no mention of active attack simulation or adversarial testing."
