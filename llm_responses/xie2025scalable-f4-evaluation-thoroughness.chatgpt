{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics—precision (PRE), recall (REC), and F1-score (F-1)—but does not include any summary metric such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC, which are necessary to fully assess performance under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 11, Section 5.1: “To comprehensively evaluate the constructed model, four evaluation metrics are utilized: accuracy (ACC), recall (REC), precision (PRE), and F1 score (F-1).” Tables VIII–XI report only ACC, PRE, REC, and F-1, with no AUC or MCC mentioned."}
