    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper's method is explicitly designed to be robust against concept drift by relying on stable brand identity features (logos, names), which are less volatile than statistical or structural features. The authors state that this approach is \"relatively robust to distribution shift\". Furthermore, the paper proposes an adaptive strategy: the KnowPhish knowledge base is built via a fully automated pipeline that can be run periodically to incorporate new and emerging phishing targets, thus addressing model obsolescence. The evaluation is also informed by temporal dynamics. The design of the KnowPhish knowledge base is motivated by an empirical analysis of concept drift between two phishing datasets collected three years apart. A key component of the proposed detector (the text-based CRP classifier) is trained on data from late 2022 and then evaluated as part of the full system on a distinct, more recent dataset from mid-to-late 2023. This combination of using drift-resistant features, proposing an automated adaptation mechanism, and performing a temporally-aware evaluation fulfills the criteria for a high rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 3, Section 1: \"invariant that does not change over time, it is relatively robust to distribution shift [33, 34].\"\n\nPage 8, Section 4.4.2, Adapting to Evolving Phishing Targets: \"Since KnowPhish is built in a fully automatic manner, one can simply handle such information obsolescence by regularly reconstructing KnowPhish to search for new potential phishing targets outside B. Such regular updates allow the RBPD method to remain effective in countering attacks targeting these emerging brands.\"\n\nPage 5, Section 4.1.1, Data: The paper analyzes two distinct datasets to understand temporal shifts: \"The first dataset, D₁, includes phishing webpages that were collected by [33] from OpenPhish [42] three years ago... The second dataset, D2, comprises phishing samples obtained from APWG [7] at the end of 2022.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 6.1, Datasets: The component evaluation demonstrates a temporal split. The CRP classifier is trained on older data: \"we also manually extracted and labeled 2555 samples to train an XLM-ROBERTa [13], our text-based CRP classifier. This dataset contains 1094 phishing samples from D2\". The main system is then evaluated on newer data: \"TR-OP: A manually labeled and balanced dataset ... The phishing samples were crawled and validated within 6 months from July to December 2023\"."
