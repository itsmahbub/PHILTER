{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation uses a single generic Kaggle URL dataset without any mention of sampling or testing on low-reputation/long-tail domains or on benign pages containing legitimate brand elements. Thus it lacks both required subsets for ‘High’ or at least one for ‘Medium’.","evidence":"Page 6, Section VI.A.1 (‘DATASET’): “Within this research, we have chosen the dataset labelled ‘Phishing Website URLs’ sourced from Kaggle and consists of 549,346 URLs.” No further description of including long-tail domains or brand-element pages."}
