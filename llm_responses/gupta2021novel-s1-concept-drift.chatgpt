{"value":"Low","why":"The paper relies solely on nine static lexical URL features and evaluates performance via a random train–test split of the 2016 dataset, with no mention of time-based splits, continual retraining, or inherently stable features to counter evolving phishing tactics. Thus, it assumes phishing strategies remain static and does not address concept drift.","evidence":"Page 52, Section 4.3 (“Once the dataset gets standardized, it is then split into the training set and testing set. The training set data contains 15971 instances, whereas the testing set contains 3993 instances.”); lack of any temporal evaluation or adaptive learning discussion throughout the paper."}
