{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method assumes static phishing characteristics and does not employ adaptive strategies for concept drift (e.g., continual learning or time-aware features), nor does it evaluate performance on temporally separated train/test splits. Instead, it uses random cross-validation on aggregated data, offering no assessment of resilience to evolving attacker tactics.","evidence":"Page 11, Section V.B: “This experiment is performed on DATA2 with 5-fold cross-validation.”"}
