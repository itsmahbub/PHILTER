    "why": "The proposed method is a multi-layer stacked ensemble model, combining several machine learning classifiers (MLP, KNN, RF, LR, XGB) in a sequential, layered architecture. This stacking approach inherently creates a complex, opaque system where the final prediction is based on the outputs of intermediate models rather than directly on the initial input features. The paper's primary focus is on maximizing predictive accuracy, and it provides no mechanism for interpreting or explaining the model's decisions. There is no mention of using inherently interpretable models for decision tracing, nor the application of post-hoc XAI techniques like SHAP or LIME. The model functions as a pure black box. The authors explicitly state that identifying significant features is a direction for future work, confirming its absence in the current model.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section III-C, \"MLSELM\": \"The classification algorithms such as XGB,LR,RF,MLP, and KNN are encompassed in first layer, The XGB, RF and MLP are combined in second layer and finally, XGB act as Meta-layer. The Layer-I, Layer-II, and meta layer are stacked... First layer takes phishing dataset as input to all five classifier after applying balancing process on phishing dataset. Then, passes the result of the first layer to all classifiers of second layer and then, the results of layer-II are passed to meta layer.\"\n\nPage 9, Section VI, \"Conclusion\": \"In future, we would like to use various feature selection algorithms to identify the significant features from the given datasets.\""
