{"value":"Medium","why":"The detection model is wholly transparent and based on hand-crafted features (e.g. eight visual features in Section 3.1.3) combined via a rule-based, multi-criteria decision module (Section 3.1.4). The paper publishes global feature definitions and weights (Table 2), but does not provide per‐decision explanations (e.g. exact feature contributions for each classification) nor employ post-hoc XAI techniques such as SHAP/LIME or attention/gradient heatmaps.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 3.1.3 (“we propose a total of eight features F1…F8”); Page 6, Table 2 (“Weight setting of each feature”); no mention of per‐decision XAI or explanation outputs"}
