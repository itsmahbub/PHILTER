{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishIntention relies on inherently stable visual features (brand logos, abstract webpage layouts, and dynamic interaction cues) rather than volatile HTML or URL characteristics, and its real-world evaluation includes a two-month continuous field study that discovers new, unseen phishing pages (“time-forward” deployment). However, it does not incorporate explicit continual learning or periodic retraining on temporally separated datasets.","evidence":"Section 4.2 (OCR-aided Logo Recognition): “Our OCR-aided Siamese model … balances appearance-based and text-shape features, which is also significantly more time-efficient than full OCR … robust to potential HTML obfuscation.”; Section 10.2 (Field Study): “we conduct a continuous field study on the Internet for two months to discover emerging phishing webpages. PhishIntention detects 1,942 new phishing webpages (1,368 not reported by VirusTotal).”"}
