{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishBERT employs a URL-based, tactic-agnostic design—pre-training on a massive, diverse URL corpus and learning representations directly from raw URL strings via a custom tokenizer—to capture a wide range of URL-based phishing tactics (e.g., lexical manipulations, subdomain structures, homographs). However, while this approach implicitly addresses multiple tactics observable in URL patterns, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of tactics in the evaluation dataset nor report performance per tactic, fulfilling the “Medium” criteria.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “Using a tailor pre-training objective, PhishBERT obtained a general understanding of various URLs by being pretrained on a corpus of more than 3 billion unlabeled URL data.”; Page 1, Introduction: “phishing detection models require excellent generalization and resiliency to be able to handle variations of phishing URLs.”; Page 2, Section 2.2: URL tokenizer via BPE learns syntax/lexical patterns without manual features; Page 4, Section 4 (Numerical Evaluation): performance metrics (Accuracy, F1, TPR@FPR) are reported only on the aggregated dataset without any per-tactic analysis."}
