{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates false positives only on benign pages drawn from Alexa’s ranking (i.e. popular, high-reputation sites) and does not include any low-reputation/long-tail domains or benign pages embedding legitimate brand elements. This limited benign set risks underestimating real-world false positive rates.","evidence":"Page 4, Section 4 (‘The dataset chosen to train and test our models was the one introduced in [22]. The dataset was built by collecting data about well-known phishing URLs from PhishTank and benign URLs from Alexa.’)"}
