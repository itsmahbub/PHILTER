    "why": "The paper proposes a method that is tactic-agnostic by design. The core mechanism—identifying a brand from webpage content (screenshot/HTML) and then verifying if the URL's domain name corresponds to that brand—is inherently resilient to a wide range of phishing tactics. This includes tactics related to hosting (e.g., on trusted shared domains or compromised sites) and URL manipulation (e.g., subdomain spoofing, lexical variations), as the detection logic is independent of these factors. \n\nThe authors go beyond just claiming this generalizability. They dedicate a significant section (VII. Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks) to quantitatively evaluate their method's performance against specific, sophisticated evasion tactics from prior research. They test against two distinct attack types: 'Webpage source perturbation' (e.g., altering images, introducing typos in brand names) and 'Noise perturbation on Logo.' The paper provides a detailed quantitative breakdown of the detection performance for each of these tactics in a dedicated table (Table IV), reporting the number of correct, wrong, and error cases for each model tested. This explicit evaluation and per-tactic reporting against known attack vectors fulfill the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section VII. ROBUSTNESS AGAINST ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS: 'We examine the effectiveness of the adversarial attack against LLMs with the same image datasets that are used by these studies [18], [42]. 1) Adversarial Attack 1 — Webpage source perturbation... Specifically, they used four perturbation techniques: altering the background image, modifying the footer image, introducing typos in brand name text, and unveiling the password form. 2) Adversarial Attack 2 — Noise perturbation on Logo... Lee et al. focused on perturbing the logos of popular webpages using generative models.' \n\nPage 11, Table IV: 'TABLE IV: Brand identification against adversarial samples'. This table provides a clear quantitative breakdown of the results for the two evaluated tactics ('Webpage source [42]' and 'Noise on Logo [18]'), showing 'Correct', 'Wrong', and 'Error' counts for each of the three LLMs. For instance, for GPT against 'Webpage source [42]', the results are 133 Correct, 0 Wrong, 0 Error.\n\nPage 9, Section G: The paper contrasts its broader coverage with that of systems trained on fixed brand lists, stating: 'This capability extends detection coverage to a wide range of brands, including those beyond the protected set.' This supports the claim of a more generalizable, tactic-agnostic design."
