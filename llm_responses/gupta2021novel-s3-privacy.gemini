    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper explicitly designs its method to be self-contained and operate without external dependencies, which is a key characteristic of a high privacy-preserving approach. The detection relies solely on nine lexical features extracted directly from the URL string. The authors repeatedly emphasize that their approach is 'third-party independent' and does not require network-based lookups like WHOIS or DNS. Crucially, they state the method can function 'even without an Internet connection within milliseconds,' confirming that the feature extraction and classification process runs entirely locally. The paper also highlights its suitability for client-side deployment in browsers, mobile apps, and even resource-constrained IoT devices. This local processing model ensures that full URLs or other potentially sensitive user data are not transmitted to external servers for inference.",
