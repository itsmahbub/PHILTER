    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation reports some, but not all, of the required metrics for a comprehensive assessment under class imbalance. It consistently uses Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) as a summary metric across multiple experiments and tables. It also explicitly reports the True Positive Rate (Recall) and False Positive Rate at a chosen operating threshold. However, the evaluation lacks other crucial class-sensitive metrics like Precision and F1-score. Without Precision, it is difficult to assess the rate of false alarms, a critical factor for real-world deployment. Therefore, the evaluation provides some relevant metrics but lacks the full coverage required for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section 6.2: The paper reports AUC-ROC and provides components of the confusion matrix: 'After performing the correct matches, we computed the false positive and true positive rates at different thresholds where the positive class is phishing which yielded ROC area of 0.9879.'\n\nPage 7, Table 1 & Table 3: These tables consistently report 'ROC Area' (AUC-ROC) as a primary performance metric alongside 'Top-1 Match' (a form of recall/accuracy).\n\nPage 8, Section 6.6: The paper explicitly discusses the trade-off between true and false positives: '...Figure 7b shows the true and false positive rates of the test set over different thresholds...which achieves ≈93% true positive rate at ≈4% false positive rate.'\n\nA full-text search confirms that the terms 'Precision' and 'F1-score' are not mentioned in the paper."
