    "why": "The paper proposes a comparative study of 16 static machine learning models using a fixed set of features. The methodology does not include any adaptive strategies, such as periodic retraining or online learning, to address the evolution of phishing tactics over time (concept drift). The evaluation protocol explicitly relies on 10-fold cross-validation with a random split of the data. This approach mixes older and newer data samples between training and testing folds, which fails to simulate a real-world scenario where a model must predict future, unseen attacks. By not using a time-aware evaluation (e.g., training on data from an earlier period and testing on data from a later period), the study cannot assess the models' resilience to concept drift and assumes a static threat landscape.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 4.1: \"The two classes training and testing based on the 10-fold cross-validation. The Collected primarily from archive PhishTank, archive MillerSmiles, query operators Google. (R. M. Mohammad, Thabtah, McCluskey, & Engineering, 2015), started in 2012 and last modified in 2018, validation by random method.\" This quote confirms the use of a random cross-validation method on a dataset spanning multiple years (2012-2018), which is not a valid protocol for evaluating adaptation to concept drift."
