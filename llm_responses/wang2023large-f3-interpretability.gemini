    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes PhishBERT, a model based on the Transformer architecture, which is inherently a complex, non-interpretable model often referred to as a \"black box\". The authors do not describe any methods, either inherent to the model or applied post-hoc, to explain the reasoning behind individual classification decisions. The entire focus of the methodology and evaluation is on predictive performance (accuracy, F1-score, TPR@FPR) and robustness, with no mention of interpretability or explainability techniques like SHAP, LIME, or even visualizing attention weights to highlight which parts of a URL contributed to a phishing classification. The system provides a prediction without any mechanism to audit or understand its basis.",
    "evidence": "Page 2, Section 2.1, Network Architecture: \"PhishBERT uses the exact same network architecture as BERT [8], i.e., a stack of 12-layer Transformer [11] network encoders.\" This establishes the model as a complex deep learning architecture that is not inherently transparent.\n\nPage 3, Section 4, Metrics: \"Metrics. We use the following three metrics, accuracy, F1-score, TPR@FPR=0.01%.\" The evaluation is strictly based on performance metrics, with no mention of any interpretability analysis.\n\nPage 4, Section 6, Conclusion: \"By setting some challenging experiments, we show that PhishBERT has better generalization, robustness, and few-samples learning ability against current state-of-the-art detection models.\" The summary of the model's contributions focuses entirely on performance and learning efficiency, omitting any discussion of explainability."
