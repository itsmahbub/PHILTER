    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper reports class-sensitive metrics (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) for each target brand, which is a key component of a robust evaluation. However, it fails to report any of the required summary metrics like AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC that are necessary to evaluate overall classification quality under class imbalance. The main metrics used for model comparison are accuracy (Table IV) and the per-brand metrics (Table VII), but the lack of a comprehensive summary metric prevents the evaluation from being considered fully robust according to the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section V. RESULTS, Table VII: The paper provides a detailed breakdown of performance for each target brand using class-sensitive metrics. The table is explicitly titled \"PRECISION BY TARGET BRAND\" and includes columns for \"Precision\", \"Recall\", and \"F1-score\". While this is good, the paper lacks summary metrics. The primary overall performance metric used is Accuracy, as shown in Table IV."
