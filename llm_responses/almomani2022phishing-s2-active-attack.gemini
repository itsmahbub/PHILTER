    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper evaluates 16 machine learning models using static features extracted from URLs, HTML, and JavaScript. The evaluation is conducted on two pre-existing, static datasets. The methodology does not include any experiments to test the system's resilience against active attacks or evasive maneuvers. The study focuses on comparing the classification performance of different algorithms on a fixed set of known phishing and benign samples. There is no mention of testing against obfuscated code (e.g., JavaScript), adversarial manipulations of features, cloaking, or other techniques designed to bypass detectors. The evaluation is strictly a benchmark on clean, labeled data, which corresponds to the 'Low' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 10, Section 4.1, \"This experiment was conducted using CPU: I7, 8GB Memory (RAM), Python 3.6.0 Programming Language in implementations. The two classes training and testing based on the 10-fold cross-validation. The Collected primarily from archive PhishTank, archive MillerSmiles, query operators Google... The researchers of the present study used the Huddersfield university dataset... The result was built based on 70% training and testing.\"\n\nPage 12, Section 4.2, \"We used different datasets in this study to investigate the ML algorithms' performance... Dataset 2(Tan, 2018) has 48 different attributes gathered from 5000 different phishing and legal websites... This dataset contains 48 Semantic URL features that are extracted from five thousand phishing web pages and five thousand genuine webpages.\"\n\nThese sections demonstrate that the evaluation is performed on static, pre-collected datasets without any form of active attack simulation or robustness testing."
