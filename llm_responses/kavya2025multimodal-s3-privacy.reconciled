{"value":"Low","why":"While the paper describes federated learning (FGCL-Net) to protect raw data during model training, it provides no details on how inference (real-time detection) handles user data. There is no discussion of client-side or in-boundary deployment for detection, no hashed or truncated URL lookups, and no mechanism preventing transmission of full URLs, page content, or screenshots at inference time. Thus, the method does not meet even the Medium criteria for inference-time privacy safeguards.","evidence":"Section III (‘Proposed Model Design’) – FGCL-Net (equations 12–15) discusses privacy-preserving training only. No deployment or inference-time data-handling mechanisms are described anywhere in the paper."}
