{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper evaluates the proposed VisualPhishNet using matching accuracy (percent correct matches) and a summary metric (ROC AUC), but does not report any class-sensitive metrics such as precision, recall or F1-score, which are required for a ‘High’ rating under the codebook. Thus it provides some relevant metrics but lacks full coverage.","evidence":"Page 7, Section 6.1 (“Evaluation metrics”): “we computed the percentage of correct matches … We also calculated the overall accuracy … to calculate the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve area.” No precision, recall or F1-score are reported anywhere in the evaluation.
