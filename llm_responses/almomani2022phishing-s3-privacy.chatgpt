{"value":"Low","why":"The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving deployment or data-handling mechanisms. It relies on extracting full URL and page content features (including HTML/JavaScript features and querying external services for website traffic, PageRank, Google Index, etc.) without any sanitization or client-side–only processing. There is no mention of hashing URLs, federated learning, or anonymization to prevent leakage of sensitive URL data.","evidence":"Page 11 (Experiment 1 description) and Table 2 (Domain-based Features: “Website Traffic,” “PageRank,” “Google Index”) — full URLs are sent to external services for feature extraction, with no privacy safeguards discussed."}
