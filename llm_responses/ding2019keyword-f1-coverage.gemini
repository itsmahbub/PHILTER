    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper's proposed method (SHLR) explicitly addresses a diverse set of phishing tactics, primarily focusing on URL obfuscation techniques. The second stage of the method employs a set of seven heuristic rules, each designed to detect a specific tactic, such as using an IP address as a domain name (Rule 5), including multiple brand names in the URL path (Rules 1 & 2), and various lexical manipulations (Rules 3, 4, 6, 7). The paper perfectly aligns with the 'High' criteria by both providing a quantitative breakdown of the prevalence of these tactics within its evaluation dataset (PhishTank) and reporting the detection performance for each individual rule, effectively linking detection counts to specific tactics.",
    "evidence": "1. **Quantitative breakdown of evaluation dataset by tactic:** Page 8, Table 2, \"URL exception information statistics.\" This table provides percentages for different tactics found in the PhishTank dataset, such as \"Multiple identification name (%)\", \"Hidden phishing target words (%)\", \"Violation of naming standards (%)\", and \"IP as a domain name (%)\". For instance, it states that 6.9% of PhishTank URLs have multiple identification names and 0.68% use an IP as a domain name.\n2. **Reporting detection performance for each tactic:** Page 14, Table 9, \"The effect of heuristic rule-based detection phase.\" This table reports the \"number of URLs filtered by\" each specific rule (Rules 1-7) on the PhishTank dataset. This directly shows the detection performance for the corresponding tactic. For example, it reports that Rule 1 detected 229 phishing URLs, Rule 5 (IP as domain) detected 24, and Rule 7 (TLDs in non-domain part) detected 119."
