    "why": "The proposed method is inherently interpretable on a per-decision basis. Its core mechanism involves extracting specific visual regions from a webpage's screenshot, which are then used as queries in a reverse image search to identify the potential target brand. The final classification depends on the visual similarity between the suspicious page and the identified target. This process provides a clear causal chain for any given classification. The system can explain its decision by highlighting the exact visual regions (effectively, bounding boxes) on the input screenshot that were used to find the target, and then presenting the identified target and the resulting similarity score. This aligns directly with the 'High' criterion of providing 'per-decision explanation via ... bounding‑box overlays', as the identified regions are the primary drivers of the classification.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Figure 4: This figure, titled 'Steps undertaking while extracting visual features from a screenshot of a phishing website impersonating Netflix', visually demonstrates the process. Sub-figure (d) specifically shows the final extracted regions, such as the 'NETFLIX' logo, which serve as the direct input for the target identification step.\n\nPage 5, Section 3.2.2 Visual features: The paper details the process of identifying these regions: 'Step 3: Topological structural analysis [40] is then applied to the image to identify all connected components. Applying this algorithm gives us information about the boundaries and hierarchy of every region within the image.' This confirms that the method operates on discrete, bounded visual components.\n\nPage 4, Section 3.1 Overview of the approach: The text describes the overall logic: 'regions potentially containing identifiable information are extracted from the screenshot. These features include, but are not limited to, logos, slogans, parts of header images... The extracted features are used as search terms to find websites similar to the current web page through a search engine (3).'"
