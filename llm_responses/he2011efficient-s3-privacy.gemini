    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method is designed for client-side deployment as a browser toolbar, where 11 of the 12 features are extracted locally from the page's DOM, URL, and other browser-accessible information. However, one key feature, F12 (Search Engine), requires sending a query to an external third-party service (Google). This query consists of the page's base domain and the top five keywords derived from its content (the term identity set). This constitutes an external data transmission that reveals the user's browsing activity. While this prevents a 'High' rating, it does not send the full, unfiltered URL (with query parameters) or the entire page content. The transmitted data is a summarized and somewhat sanitized representation of the webpage. This partial transmission aligns with the 'Medium' criterion, as it is less invasive than sending raw, complete data. The authors also explicitly state they limited external network calls to only this one feature, rejecting others like Whois and domain age lookups, indicating some consideration for performance and third-party dependency, which indirectly serves as a partial privacy safeguard.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.12, \"This feature, F12, is adopted from the CANTINA final tf-idf method (Zhang et al., 2007). We perform a search on a search engine (we use Google) using the base domain and the term identity set of a page as the keyword.\"\nPage 8, Section 4.14(c), \"We decided to apply the search engine feature as the only feature that needs to connect to a third party service, since this feature alone has been proven to be working pretty good at the CANTINA method evaluation result.\"\nPage 2, Section 2, \"The best environment to apply our phishing detection method is to deploy it as a browser toolbar, where it can retrieve the DOM tree and other related information of a webpage from the web browser.\""
