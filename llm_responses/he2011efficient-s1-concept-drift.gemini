    "why": "The paper meets both criteria for a 'High' rating. First, the method is designed to be resilient to concept drift by focusing on relatively stable, identity-based signals rather than easily changed syntactic features. The core idea is to detect inconsistencies between the claimed identity (from page content, using tf-idf) and the actual identity (from the domain name, URL structure, and search engine reputation). These identity-based features (e.g., F2, F4, F6, F12) are less volatile than simple URL patterns that attackers frequently modify. Second, the evaluation protocol explicitly addresses temporal dynamics. In the second experiment, the model is trained using a dataset that includes older, shutdown phishing pages (from CastleCops) and then tested against a dataset of 'new and live phishing pages' collected from PhishTank over four consecutive days. This train-on-older, test-on-newer methodology directly evaluates the model's ability to generalize to future attacks, which is a core requirement for assessing adaptation to concept drift.",

If a website claims a fake identity then it would be abnormal, compared to a legitimate site. These abnormalities would be the basis to differentiate between the legitimate and phishing websites."
