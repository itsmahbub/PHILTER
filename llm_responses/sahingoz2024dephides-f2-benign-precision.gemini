    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The evaluation relies exclusively on high-reputation domains for its benign dataset, which does not adequately test for false positives on more challenging, real-world examples. The authors explicitly state their methodology for collecting legitimate URLs involves selecting from the top 100,000 domains based on PageRank. This approach systematically excludes low-reputation, long-tail, and newly registered domains where detection models often struggle. Furthermore, the paper provides no evidence of including benign pages that make legitimate use of third-party brand elements (e.g., embedded PayPal buttons, social media login widgets), which is another critical component for a diverse benign test set. The evaluation is therefore limited to popular, well-established sites and does not meet the criteria for medium or high diversity.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section IV-A, DATASET COLLECTION: \"To compile the legitimate URL dataset, the first 100,000 domains from PageRank rankings worldwide, calculated by Common Crawl using data from web crawling, were utilized. For each of these domains, approximately 30 random URLs were selected, resulting in a collection of 2,881,948 legitimate URLs.\" \n\nThe paper further justifies this choice, confirming the focus on high-reputation sites: \"The concept that well-known legitimate domains receiving a considerable number of backlinks tend to have high rankings is a valid observation. It’s challenging for a domain to rank prominently in search engine results if it is being used for malicious purposes, as search engines aim to provide users with the most relevant and trustworthy content. Therefore, the inclusion of such domains in the legitimate URL dataset ensures the reliability of the data collected.\""
