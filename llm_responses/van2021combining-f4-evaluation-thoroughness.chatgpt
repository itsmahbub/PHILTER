{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics (precision and F1-score) and a summary metric (AUC-ROC), but it does not report recall, thus lacking full coverage of the required class-sensitive metrics under class imbalance.","evidence":"Section 4.4 (Classification performance), Table 5: “Table 5 reports accuracy (Acc.), precision (Prec.), f1-score and AUC for the different visual similarity-based approaches.”"}
