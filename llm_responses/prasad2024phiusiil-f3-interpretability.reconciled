{"value":"Medium","why":"While PhiUSIIL offers no per-decision explanations at inference time, it does compute global feature importances during development (using RandomForest, DecisionTree, LGBM, XGBoost and mutual information) to select its feature set. This provides a limited, global view of which inputs influence the model overall, but it lacks per-instance traceability or XAI heatmaps, placing it in the “Medium” interpretability tier.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 4.2.1: “We implemented RandomForestClassifier, Decision-TreeClassifier, LGBMClassifier, and XGBClassifier to find the importance of each feature… The top 85% of features are selected based on their higher Mutual_info_classif value.”"}
