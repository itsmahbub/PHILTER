{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed STFL method focuses solely on generic URL character–based features and evaluates performance on benchmark phishing/benign URL datasets without any consideration or breakdown of specific phishing tactics (e.g., homograph attacks, subdomain spoofing, use of IP URLs, URL redirection, hosting environment). No per-tactic performance is reported, and the datasets contain only labels for phishing vs. benign URLs, with no information on the diversity of phishing strategies.","evidence":"Page 1, Section I: “In this paper, we focus on the URL character–based approach, which is more common today [28].” \nPage 5, Section V.A (Datasets): Describes only benchmark URL collections (CPURNN, PDRCNN, Khramtsova et al.) with phishing vs. benign labels and no per-tactic annotations or breakdown."}
