{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics (precision and recall) and presents ROC curves, but it does not include F1-scores or any numeric area-under-curve (AUC-ROC or AUC-PR) or Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Therefore it provides some relevant metrics but lacks the full set of class-imbalance summary measures required for a “High” evaluation.","evidence":"Table 2 (page 3799): lists only “Precision” and “Recall” without F1-score. Figure 10 (page 3799): shows ROC curves but does not report numeric AUC-ROC values."}
