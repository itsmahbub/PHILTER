{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation benign dataset is constructed exclusively from Alexa (popular, high-reputation) and Curlie sites, with no mention of including low-reputation/long-tail domains or pages containing legitimate brand elements such as OAuth widgets or embedded logos. Thus, it does not satisfy either of the two required subsets for a high or medium diversity assessment.","evidence":"Page 7–8, Section 5.1.1 (“Dataset”) – “P-URLs (positive samples)… and B-URLs (negative samples) are sourced from Alexa and Curlie.” No further subsets (e.g., long-tail domains or brand-element pages) are described."}
