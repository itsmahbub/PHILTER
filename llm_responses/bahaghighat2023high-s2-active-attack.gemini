    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's methodology and evaluation are confined to a static, public dataset. The proposed method uses machine learning models trained on 111 pre-extracted static features, primarily related to URL structure, domain properties, and external metrics. The entire experimental setup involves splitting this dataset, applying balancing techniques (SMOTEENN), dropping constant features, and then training and testing various classifiers. There is no mention or evaluation of the system's resilience to active attacks, such as URL obfuscation, adversarial examples crafted to mislead the classifier, cloaking, or dynamic content loading. The evaluation is limited to classifying pre-existing, non-manipulated phishing and benign examples, which directly corresponds to the criteria for a 'Low' rating.",
    "evidence": "page 4, Section 3.1. Dataset: \"In our work, a public dataset has been evaluated with a deep investigation to conclude whether it is proper to forecast future phishing attacks or not. All of the characteristics are gathered from Phishing Websites Dataset, which was published in 2020 [27]. The dataset has 88,647 instances with 111 features and a labeled output column.\"\n\npage 4, Section 3. Methodology: \"Explaining the dataset with visualization tools, feature selection, performing Imblearn's SMOTEENN to make the dataset balanced, creating an innovative model, testing, and ultimately juxtaposing the results are the components of our method to detect phishing websites... 80% of the dataset is used to train our model, and 20% of the dataset is used for testing to evaluate its performance.\"\n\npage 12, Section 4.2. Examined scenarios: \"The fixed conditions for all algorithms are the training and test set sizes (80% and 20%, respectively) and ten-fold cross-validation.\" This confirms that the evaluation is a standard classification task on a static dataset, without any component designed to test robustness against evasive or adversarial attacks."
