{"value":"Medium","why":"While the authors discuss “interpretability” and present global analyses (correlation matrices, PCA visualizations, silhouette scores) to give insight into which features generally separate phishing from genuine sites, they do not provide per-decision explanations (e.g. SHAP/LIME values, attention heat-maps, or decision paths) for individual classifications. Thus, the method affords limited, global interpretability rather than true per-instance traceability.","evidence":"Section IV.C (Interpretablity Measures): “The PCA transformation, cluster assessment, and binary encoding processes also help to improve the interpretability of the model’s conclusions.”; Figures 6–10 (correlation matrices) and Figure 13 (PCA plot) demonstrate only global insights rather than per-decision explanations."}
