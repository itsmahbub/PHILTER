{"value":"High","why":"The proposed detection runs entirely on-device using only locally extracted URL and HTML features, with no reliance on or transmission to third-party services or external servers, thus ensuring no sensitive data (full URLs, HTML content, screenshots) is sent off-device.","evidence":"Page 1 (Abstract): “we design lightweight URL and HTML features and introduce HTML string embedding without using the third-party services, making it possible to develop real-time detection applications.”; Page 3 (Section 3.1.1): “the artificially designed features adopted in our work are lightweight, which only deal with the current page information and do not rely on third-party services.”"}
