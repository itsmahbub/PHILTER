{"value":"High","why":"PhiUSIIL is explicitly built as an adaptive incremental‐learning system, and its evaluation protocol simulates a time‐forward deployment by processing records in chronological order: the model is initialized on the earliest data and, for each new record, first makes a prediction and then updates itself with that record. This satisfies both criteria for a “High” rating—an adaptive strategy by design and an evaluation on data drawn from different time periods.","evidence":"Page 2, Section 1: “the incremental learning approach allows the framework to continuously update its knowledge base with new data … It enables the model to stay up-to-date, making it adaptable to changing data.”\n\nPage 10, Algorithm 3: for each record i the model executes “pr = model.predict(X)” then “model.partial_fit(X, Y, classes=[0,1])”, clearly training on earlier data and testing on later data in sequence.\n\nPage 3, Section 3.1.1: dataset collected from October 2022 to May 2023, providing a time‐stamped stream of URLs for sequential evaluation.
