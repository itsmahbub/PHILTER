{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed DEPHIDES system is treated as a pure black-box classifier on URLs using deep neural networks and no mechanism—neither inherently interpretable model paths nor post-hoc XAI techniques—is provided to explain individual decisions or highlight the influential URL features. There is no discussion of attention visualization, SHAP/LIME attributions, feature importance tables, or decision trees anywhere in the text.","evidence":"Page 8053, Contributions (bullet list): no mention of interpretability or explanations; Sections IV–V: entirely describe dataset, architectures, and performance metrics without any XAI or explanation method"}
