{"value":"Low","why":"The paper only evaluates detection accuracy on a static, clean phishing vs. benign website dataset (UCI phishing website data) and does not include any experiments or analysis of active evasion techniques (e.g., obfuscated JavaScript, dynamic content loading, cloaking, adversarial perturbations) within its URL/feature-based scope.","evidence":"Page 1865, Abstract: “Based on testing of a set of phishing and benign websites, we have noted that this novel phishing detection model achieves the best Accuracy…”; Page 1868, Section 4.2: “We adopt dataset named Phishing website dataset come from the UCI repository. This dataset … consists of 11,055 samples … pre-classified as phishing and benign.” No further evaluation against adversarial or evasive manipulations is described."}
