{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed hybrid identity-based detector does not account for the wide range of real-world phishing tactics (e.g. HTTPS misuse, subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, shared hosting), nor does it report per-tactic detection results. The evaluation uses generic phishing samples from PhishTank/OpenPhish and Alexa top sites without any breakdown by tactic.","evidence":"Page 11, Section 4.1 (‘Legitimate webpages were collected based on the Alexa top 1 million list… phishing webpages were sourced from URLs in PhishTank and OpenPhish …’); Page 12, Table 4 (reports only overall TPR/TNR/accuracy, no per-tactic performance)."}
