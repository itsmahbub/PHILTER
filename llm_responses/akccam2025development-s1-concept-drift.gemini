    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's method is designed to be adaptable to evolving phishing tactics by avoiding static, hand-crafted features. It automatically learns discriminative patterns from raw URL data at both character and word levels using deep learning (BiLSTM). The authors explicitly state that this approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods that rely on features which can become outdated as attacks change. This constitutes a design that aims to be resilient to concept drift. However, the experimental evaluation does not validate this resilience over time. The datasets are split randomly (80% train, 20% test) rather than chronologically. A robust evaluation for concept drift would involve training the model on older data and testing its performance on more recent data to simulate real-world deployment. Because the paper employs a design intended to handle drift but lacks a corresponding time-aware evaluation protocol, it meets the criteria for a \"Medium\" rating.",
    "evidence": "Design for adaptation: 'The continuous evolution of phishing attacks raises questions about the reliability of these pre-extracted features. Consequently, it has become critically necessary for new models to identify unique features based on URL addresses.' (Page 3, Section 2).\n'Due to reliance on fixed rules, heuristic methods are insufficient to adapt to new and sophisticated phishing techniques. In contrast, the proposed model demonstrates high generalisation performance when trained on large datasets, thanks to its learning-based structure. ... The proposed model overcomes this limitation by automatically extracting and integrating character and word-based features.' (Page 27, Section 6).\nLack of temporal evaluation: 'Therefore, the datasets were initially randomly divided into two distinct subsets in an 80-20 ratio, one designated for training and the other for testing. Subsequently, the training dataset underwent another random split into training and validation subsets, also in an 80-20 ratio (Fig. 12).' (Page 17, Section 4.4)."
