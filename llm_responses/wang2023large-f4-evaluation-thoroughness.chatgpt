{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper reports accuracy, F1-score, and TPR@FPR (a single operating-point recall) but does not provide precision or overall recall, nor does it include any summary metrics such as AUC-PRC, AUC-ROC, or MCC. Thus it covers some class-sensitive metrics but lacks the full set required for a high‐quality evaluation under class imbalance.","evidence":"Page 3, Section 4 (Numerical Evaluation) – “Metrics. We use the following three metrics, accuracy, F1-score, TPR@FPR=0.01%.”"}
