    "why": "The paper's method is explicitly designed to provide per-decision interpretations for its classifications. The system uses a two-phase approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) are prompted not only to identify the brand and classify the page but also to generate natural language 'Supporting Evidence' explaining their reasoning. The paper provides clear examples of these outputs, which detail the specific visual cues (logo, color scheme) and textual information (HTML title, domain name) that contributed to the decision. This generative self-explanation functions as a per-decision traceability mechanism, offering a clear and accessible rationale for each prediction, which aligns directly with the 'High' fulfillment criteria.",
    "evidence": "page: 7, section: V-C Interpretation of phishing classification (Q5)\n\nsupporting quote: a) Brand identification by first-phase LLM: ...in our design, the first-phase LLM gives the identified brand and supporting evidence as output... An example output for a WhatsApp phishing page includes: \"Supporting Evidence: The screenshot prominently displays the WhatsApp logo along with a characteristic green color scheme... The title in the HTML information, 'WhatsApp,' the meta description, and headers text also merely state 'WhatsApp,' reaffirming the identity of the webpage as belonging to WhatsApp.\"\n\nb) Phishing classification by second-phase LLM: An example output shows the final classification and its reasoning: \"Evidence: The URL uses the domain 'polert.xyz' instead of the official domain 'whatsapp.com', which suggests it is not associated with the official WhatsApp brand and may be suspicious or malicious.\""
