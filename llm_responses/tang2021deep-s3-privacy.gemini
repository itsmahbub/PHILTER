    "why": "The paper describes a browser extension that sends the user's full, currently accessed URL to a remote, cloud-based server for inference. The architecture explicitly relies on a 'Prediction API for Checking URL' which is called by the client-side extension. The implementation details confirm that the extension 'gets the URL currently accessed, calls the back-end prediction service'. Transmitting full, raw URLs off the user's device poses a direct privacy risk, as URLs can contain sensitive session tokens, personal identifiers, or other private information in their path or query parameters. The paper does not mention any privacy-preserving mechanisms such as hashing, URL truncation, sanitization, or on-device feature extraction to mitigate this risk.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section IV.C. WEB BROWSER EXTENSION: 'A background script listens for browser tab change events, gets the URL currently accessed, calls the back-end prediction service to get the result, and finally sends the result to a content script.'\nPage 4, Section III. FRAMEWORK DESIGN: 'The core process of this framework is mainly divided into the following six steps: ... the fourth is that the browser extension calls the prediction interface to perform real-time detection and display the detection results...'\nPage 3, FIGURE 1: The architecture diagram shows a 'Web Browser Extension' communicating with a 'Cloud Application' via a 'Prediction API for Checking URL', indicating that the URL is sent from the client to the server for analysis."
