    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper's proposed method is designed for local, real-time execution and explicitly states independence from third-party services as a key advantage. The detection process relies on features extracted directly and exclusively from the URL string. All described components, including URL parsing, word decomposition (using local libraries like Enchant), gibberish detection (using a local Markov Chain model), and maliciousness analysis (calculating Levenshtein distance against local keyword lists), are self-contained. Even the feature that checks against the Alexa Top 1M list is described as a lookup, which is consistent with using a locally stored list rather than making an external API call with the user's URL. Since the entire feature extraction and classification process can run on a client device or within a secure organizational boundary without transmitting the URL or its derivatives to an external server for inference, the design is inherently privacy-preserving.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 6, \"Advantages of the proposed approach\": \"Independence from Third-Party Services: In the literature, there are many works, which use third-party services such as who is records, web-based blacklist/whitelist, ranking pages, network traffic measures, the age of domain detection, etc. Mainly, use of these services increases the efficiency of the detection/prevention system. However, if the aim is about the execution in the real-time, then these services increase the detection time; therefore, they cannot be useful.\"\nPage 11, Section 6, \"Advantages of the proposed approach\": \"Real-time Execution: Since creating a web page is a cheap and easy task, for phishing the users, an attacker can quickly construct a fraudulent web page, which is active in a short lifespan (maybe for a few hours). Therefore, detection of the phishing web page in real-time is essential for the prevention from this type of attacks. In the proposed system, features depend on the address of the web page, and some features are constructed with the help of NLP algorithms. Therefore, it is executed faster and classifies the web page in a negligible amount of time.\""
