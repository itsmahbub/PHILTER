{"value":"Low","why":"The STFL method is evaluated only on clean phishing vs. benign URL datasets without any experiments involving active evasive manipulations (e.g., junk characters, obfuscated or encoded URLs, adversarial perturbations). There is no assessment of the model’s robustness to deliberate attacks on the URL feature space.","evidence":"Section V (Evaluation) – Datasets and Experimental Setting describe only benchmark datasets (CPURNN, PDRCNN, Khramtsova et al.) and standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) on static URLs; no active attack or adversarial evasion tests are performed."}
