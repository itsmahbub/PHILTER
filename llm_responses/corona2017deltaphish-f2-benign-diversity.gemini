    "why": "The evaluation's benign dataset is constructed from legitimate pages on websites that were compromised to host phishing. This methodology inherently provides a diverse set of benign pages, including many low-reputation or \"long-tail\" domains (e.g., small businesses, personal sites) which are common targets for such compromises. The example provided in Figure 1, a landscaping company, supports this inclusion of non-top-ranked sites. However, the paper does not explicitly address the second key aspect of diversity: evaluating the detector's robustness against legitimate webpages that incorporate third-party brand elements, such as social media widgets or payment buttons (e.g., PayPal, Google/Facebook OAuth). The feature set is designed to measure intra-site consistency rather than to differentiate between legitimate and malicious use of brand assets. Since the evaluation covers low-reputation domains but does not explicitly test against legitimate brand element usage, it meets only one of the two criteria for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 12, Section 4.1, Dataset: \"Our dataset has been collected from October 2015 to January 2016, starting from active phishing URLs obtained online from the PhishTank feed. We have collected and manually validated 1,012 phishing pages. For each phishing page, we have then collected the corresponding homepage from the hosting domain. By parsing the hyperlinks in the HTML code of the homepage, we have collected from 3 to 5 legitimate pages from the same website, and validated them manually.\" This quote shows that the benign pages originate from compromised domains found in the wild, which are often long-tail websites. The lack of discussion or specific collection of pages with legitimate brand elements (e.g., PayPal buttons) indicates this aspect was not a focus of the evaluation."
