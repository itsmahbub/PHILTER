{"value":"High","why":"PhishLLM is designed to avoid drift-prone signals by eliminating any static, pre-defined reference list and instead extracting brand-domain knowledge from a large language model, and its detection performance is validated on temporally new, “zero-day” phishing sites drawn from real-world feeds. This combination of a design that eschews volatile features and an evaluation on future, unseen attacks meets the criteria for a high adaptation-to-concept-drift rating.","evidence":"Page 3, Section 3.1 (“we present PhishLLM as a novel reference-based phishing detector that operates without an explicit pre-defined reference list”); Page 11, Section 4.5 (“we deployed PhishLLM in field studies to detect emerging phishing webpages”), Table 7 (performance on 90 K newly issued domains)."}
