{"value":"Medium","why":"The approach employs a clearly tactic-agnostic design by feeding comprehensive website signals (URL, HTML code, OCR screenshot) into ChatGPT to infer phishing without hard-coding specific tactics. Its evaluation is performed on genuine phishing examples (11 real-world sites derived from Koide et al.’s JSON files), satisfying the requirement for testing on real data. However, it lacks any quantitative, per-tactic breakdown of results, preventing it from achieving a “High” rating.","evidence":"Page 2, Section III: “In the end, 11 websites were considered for further analysis.”; Fig. 1 (Page 2): “Webpage Information Extraction (HTML Code, Screenshot OCR) → Chain of Thought → Prompt ChatGPT → Output (brand, suspicious domain, phishing score…)”"}
