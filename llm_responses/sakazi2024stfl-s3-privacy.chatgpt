{"value":"High","why":"The STFL method employs federated learning so that all URL data remains on the client device and only model parameters are shared. No raw URLs, query parameters, or content ever leave the user’s device, satisfying the criteria for fully local inference or explicit privacy-preserving mechanisms.","evidence":"Page 1, Section I: “In FL, users train a global model jointly by sharing just the local models with the server. The users’ data remains on their devices, and their data’s privacy are preserved [27], [30], [37].”; Page 4, Section IV: “During the entire process, the data does not leave the user’s device; only the updated model’s parameters are sent between the user’s device and the server.”"}
