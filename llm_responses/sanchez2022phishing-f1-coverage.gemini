    "why": "The paper addresses multiple phishing tactics by conducting a detailed analysis of its phishing URL dataset. It explicitly identifies and provides a quantitative breakdown of several hosting strategies used by attackers, such as the use of free subdomains (e.g., 000webhostapp), cloud services (e.g., googleapis), and fake form platforms (e.g., docs.google), as shown in Table 8. The feature engineering also implicitly considers URL-based tactics, with handcrafted features for detecting Punycode (homograph attacks) and analyzing subdomains (subdomain spoofing). However, the paper does not meet the criteria for a 'High' rating because it fails to evaluate and report the model's detection performance against each of these identified tactic categories. The performance results are only presented in aggregate for the entire dataset.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section VI-C, CLUSTERING PHISHING URLS: \"Trying to look for phishing categories, we performed a term frequency analysis over the domain names of the URLs... In order to identify the different categories, we performed a manual analysis of the 35 most common domains. We visited those domains and we evaluated the services provided on each domain, resulting in the six categories reflected in Table 8.\"\nPage 10, Table 8: The table, titled \"Most common phishing domains on PILU-90K dataset grouped into the spotted categories\", provides a quantitative breakdown of phishing domains by type, including 'Free subdomain', 'Cloud services', and 'Fake form', along with domain counts.\nPage 9, Table 6: This table presents the overall performance of the assessed algorithms on the full datasets but does not provide a per-tactic performance breakdown based on the categories identified in Table 8."
