{"value":"Medium","why":"While DynaPhish includes explicit defenses against both visual manipulation (adversarial perturbations to screenshots) and code-level obfuscation (HTML obfuscation of input fields) and evaluates them on purpose-built adversarial datasets (satisfying the Medium criterion), it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of real phishing examples exhibiting each evasion tactic in its main evaluation (a requirement for a High rating).","evidence":"Section 9 (Adversarial Attacks) – design and evaluation of DAG attack and HTML obfuscation adversaries; Table 4 (mAP drop and recovery under DAG), Table 5 (recall drop under HTML obfuscation); no counts or proportions of these attacks in the DynaPD corpus"}
