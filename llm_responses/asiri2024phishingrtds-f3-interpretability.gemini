    "why": "The core of the detection system is a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model, which is inherently a black-box architecture. The paper does not apply any post-hoc explanation techniques like SHAP or LIME to provide per-decision reasoning for why a specific URL is flagged. However, the system's overall interpretability is not 'Low' due to two factors. First, the model architecture includes an attention mechanism designed to \"force the BiLSTM to focus on critical features of the input.\" While the authors do not use the attention weights to generate explanations or visualizations, the mechanism's presence is a component often used for interpretability. Second, and more significantly, the final decision logic, particularly the Weighted Average Strategy (WeAS), provides limited and global insight. WeAS applies explicit, predefined weights based on a URL's location within the page (e.g., main URL, IFrame, hyperlink). This allows an observer to understand how individual URL classifications are aggregated into a final page-level decision, revealing the predefined importance of different URL types. This rule-based aggregation provides a limited form of transparency into the system's final judgment, fitting the criteria for a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "page 9, section 5: \"We use BiLSTM because it can extract input data patterns and its long dependency... In addition, we use an attention mechanism to force the BiLSTM to focus on critical features of the input.\"\npage 7, section 3.4.3: \"WeAS's goal is to differentiate between URLs based on their position. For example, the URL attached to the frame (JFrame or IFrame) is more important than the social media URL (in a webpage footer), and the original URL is more important than any other URL. Therefore, we assign weight to each URL based on its essentials.\"\npage 9, Table 4: The paper provides an explicit table of these weights: \"Table 4 URL’s location Weight. Method: Webpage URL, Weight: 0.45; Method: Frame URLs, Weight: 0.30; Method: hyperlinks, Weight: 0.15; Method: Others, Weight: 0.10\""
