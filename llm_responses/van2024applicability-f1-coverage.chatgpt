{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed hybrid framework evaluates phishing detection solely as a binary classification task on a generic URL/HTML dataset without any consideration of the wide range of real‐world phishing tactics. The paper does not provide a breakdown of the evaluation data by tactic nor report performance per tactic, nor claim a tactic‐agnostic design explicitly targeted at varied evasion strategies.","evidence":"Section 5.1 Dataset: “The Phishing Website Dataset contains a recent collection of the URL and HTML of legitimate and phishing websites… The dataset contains 80,000 website samples, divided into 50,000 legitimate and 30,000 phishing…” (no information on phishing tactic diversity)"}
