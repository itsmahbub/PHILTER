    "why": "The paper addresses concept drift through both its core design and its evaluation protocol. First, the method is based on visual similarity, which the authors argue is an inherently stable feature against evolving attacker tactics. Second, the authors explicitly acknowledge the need for model maintenance and demonstrate that periodic retraining effectively adapts the model to changes in trusted websites over time. Most importantly, the evaluation is temporally sound. The model is trained on one set of data and then tested, without retraining, on a 'zero-day phishing webpage dataset' which is explicitly described as having a 'temporal separation' from the training data. This combination of using stable features, proposing an adaptive strategy, and performing a temporal evaluation meets the highest criteria for this metric.",
