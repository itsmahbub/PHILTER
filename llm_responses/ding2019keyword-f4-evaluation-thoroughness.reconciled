{"value":"High","why":"The paper reports the class-sensitive metrics precision, recall, and F-Score and also presents a Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) with explicit reference to the Area Under the Curve (AUC), thereby satisfying the requirement for at least one summary metric (AUC-PRC) in addition to the class-specific measures. This comprehensive evaluation addresses class imbalance and aligns with the ‘High’ criteria.","evidence":"Page 16, Table 15 – performance metrics include “Recall (%)”, “F-Score (%)”, and “Precision (%)”.\nPage 17, Figure 6 and accompanying text – “Fig. 6 shows the PRC comparison of the four detection methods, which indicates that the SHLR has the largest area under the curve (AUC).”"}
