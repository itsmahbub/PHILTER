    "why": "The proposed method, Phishpedia, is a content-based visual approach that is inherently robust to a wide range of phishing tactics, particularly those involving URL obfuscation. By identifying a brand's logo on a webpage and comparing the page's actual domain with the brand's legitimate domain, the system bypasses tactics like subdomain spoofing, lexical manipulations, homograph attacks, or hosting on compromised/shared domains. The system's design is therefore tactic-agnostic concerning the hosting and URL structure. The paper also demonstrates that the model can generalize to less popular brands by adding them to the target list at runtime. However, the evaluation does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the tactics present in the dataset (e.g., percentage of compromised sites, subdomain abuse), nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. It addresses multiple tactics by design but lacks the explicit, quantitative evaluation of this capability required for a 'High' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 2.2, Overview: \"Once a logo in the target brand list (e.g., that of Paypal) is matched, we consider its corresponding domain (e.g., paypal.com) as the intended domain for the captured screenshot. Subsequently, we analyze the difference between the intended domain and the domain of the given URL to report the phishing result.\" This core mechanism is independent of URL structure, making it resilient to many obfuscation tactics.\n\nPage 11, Section 5.4, Phishpedia generalization (RQ3): \"In this experiment, we evaluate whether our Siamese model is generalizable when new logos (not used in training) are added to target brand list... Among the 7,411 webpages covered by 51 “new” brands, Phishpedia recognized 87.46% phishing webpages with high identification rate of 99.91%. It indicates that the Siamese model well captures generalizable features extracted from logo samples. Thus, our approach is generalizable for adding new logos in the target brand list during runtime.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 5.1, Datasets: The description of the 'Phishing Webpage Dataset' collected from OpenPhish details the process of gathering URLs, screenshots, and manual verification of target brands. However, it does not mention any classification or analysis of the phishing tactics employed in the collected samples. Consequently, the performance evaluations in subsequent sections lack a per-tactic breakdown."
