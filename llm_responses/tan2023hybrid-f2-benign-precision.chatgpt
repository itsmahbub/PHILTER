{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation uses only high-reputation popular websites (Alexa top-1000 and top-5000–6000) as benign samples and does not include long-tail/low-reputation domains nor a set of benign pages explicitly featuring legitimate brand elements.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (Dataset preparation), page 11: “Legitimate webpages were collected based on the Alexa top 1 million list… DS-1 consisting of 500 legitimate samples sourced from the top 1000 rank of the Alexa top websites list. The second dataset (DS-2) consists of 250 legitimate webpages ranked in between the top 5000 to 6000 of the Alexa top websites list.”"}
