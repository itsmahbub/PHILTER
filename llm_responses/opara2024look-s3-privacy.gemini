    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper proposes a deep learning model, WebPhish, that requires the full raw URL and the complete HTML content of a webpage for inference. The authors do not specify the deployment architecture or describe any privacy-preserving mechanisms for handling user data in a real-world scenario. There is no mention of client-side inference (e.g., in a browser extension), secure in-boundary deployment, or techniques like hashing, federated learning, or feature anonymization. Given the model's inputs, a typical deployment would involve sending the user's full URL and the entire webpage content to an external server for analysis, which represents a significant privacy concern. The complete absence of any discussion on inference-time data handling or privacy safeguards places this method in the 'Low' category.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3, The proposed model: 'This study aims to develop a deep neural network, WebPhish, which takes a URL and its source code as input and then vectorizes the URLs and the words in the HTML source code using the Tokeniser utility class.'\n\nPage 1, Abstract: 'To address these challenges, this paper proposes WebPhish, an end-to-end deep neural network model that detects URL and HTML website phishing attacks. First, the proposed model automatically employs an embedding technique to extract the corresponding characters into homologous dense vectors.'\n\nPage 12, Section 7, Conclusion: 'Therefore, when applied in real-time, the performance of our model will not negatively impact the website’s usability when deployed in the real-world.' The paper mentions real-world deployment but provides no details on how it would be implemented, leaving the question of data transmission and privacy unaddressed throughout the text."
