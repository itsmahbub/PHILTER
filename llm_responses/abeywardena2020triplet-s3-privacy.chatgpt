  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not describe any client‐side or in‐boundary deployment for privacy, nor any privacy‐preserving mechanisms. Instead, it relies on sending full webpage screenshots to an external matching service with a stored screenshot database. No sanitization, hashing, federated learning, or on‐device inference is mentioned.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Introduction: “given a screenshot of a web page, we want to decide whether it is a possible phishing attempt to a well known website for which we have stored the screenshots … new web pages can be matched against them.” No other section discusses privacy or local inference."
