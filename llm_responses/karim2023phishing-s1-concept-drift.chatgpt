{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed system trains and evaluates models on a randomly split static dataset without any temporal division or adaptive update mechanism. There is no mention of using time-aware features, continual learning, periodic retraining, or testing on data from later periods, so the method assumes phishing tactics remain static.","evidence":"Section III.A (page 8): “The complete corpus was divided into two partitions, 70% for training and 30% for testing the 70% training data were used to train the machine learning model, preserve 30% of the data for the predictions, and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.” No temporal split or concept-drift handling is described."}
