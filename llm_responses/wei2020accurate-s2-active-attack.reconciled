{"value":"Low","why":"The paper presents a generic URL‐only CNN that does not include any explicit defenses against URL‐level manipulation or obfuscation (e.g., junk padding, punycode, homograph swaps, adversarial perturbations), nor does it evaluate on adversarial or evasion‐focused datasets. There is no quantitative breakdown of evasion tactics in its test data, and unsupported characters are simply removed rather than specially handled, indicating no resilience demonstration beyond standard URL classification.","evidence":"Section 4.2 (Text coding): “If a character was not from the above alphabet it was removed.” — no handling of obfuscated or Unicode‐based attacks\nSection 5 (Experiments): only PhishTank and Common Crawl URLs are used with a 50/50 split; no mention of adversarial or evasion‐specific test sets or coverage statistics"}
