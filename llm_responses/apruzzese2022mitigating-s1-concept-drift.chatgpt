{"value":"Low","why":"The POC method does not include any mechanisms for handling concept drift (e.g., continual learning, periodic retraining, or time-aware features), nor is it evaluated on temporally separated training and test sets. The evaluation uses random 80:20 splits without regard to sample time, and the paper only mentions future updates to combat drift rather than implementing adaptive strategies.","evidence":"Section 6.1 (Testbed): “We apply an 80:20 split for the training and test partitions…”.\nSection 3.4 (LNU-Phish Dataset Features): “ML-based detection systems must be periodically updated with recent data to avoid concept-drift problems [40],[78]. To further facilitate such ‘updates’, we will release our source code…” — but no adaptive or temporal evaluation is implemented."}
