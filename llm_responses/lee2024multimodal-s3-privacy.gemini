    "why": "The proposed phishing detection method relies on sending sensitive webpage data to external, third-party commercial LLM services for inference. Specifically, the system's first phase sends a screenshot and/or extracted HTML content of the webpage to an LLM for brand identification. The second phase sends the identified brand and the page's URL to another LLM for domain verification. This process involves transmitting the full content and URL of a user's visited page to external servers (e.g., Google, OpenAI, Anthropic) without any mention of privacy-preserving mechanisms such as on-device processing, hashing, or data anonymization. This approach directly matches the criteria for a low privacy preservation rating.",
