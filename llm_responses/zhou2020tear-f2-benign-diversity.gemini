    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The evaluation's benign dataset is limited to high-reputation, popular websites. The paper states that negative (non-phishing) samples were generated by visiting the legitimate websites corresponding to the 8 most frequently phished brands (e.g., PayPal, Microsoft, Google, Amazon). This approach does not include any low-reputation or long-tail domains. Furthermore, it fails to test against the critical case of legitimate third-party websites that use brand elements (like a PayPal payment logo or a Google login widget), a scenario the authors themselves acknowledge in the discussion section as a potential cause for misclassification. The evaluation is therefore confined to a narrow set of well-known, high-reputation domains, which are not representative of the diverse benign web.",
    "evidence": "page 11, Section 5.1: \"Similarly, we visited the corresponding legitimate websites to generate negative (non-phishing) samples... We followed SquatPhish [26] to select 8 most frequently targeted brands... They are paypal, microsoft, facebook, google, amazon, apple, dropbox, and yahoo... For each brand, we chose its primary website(s) from Alexa as our target website(s).\" \n\npage 15, Section 6: \"Some logo images may be shown on irrelevant websites. For example, the Visa logo may be shown on retailers’ homepages to show that visa cards are accepted... HTTP-hosted pages carrying Visa logos and containing forms (e.g., a retailer’s homepage with a input box for search) may be misclassified as phishing. Fortunately, such cases are very rare in our experiments and they can be fixed by adding those sites to the trusted list.\""
