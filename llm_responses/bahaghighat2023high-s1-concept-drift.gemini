    "why": "The paper treats phishing detection as a static classification problem. It trains and evaluates its models on a single, time-agnostic dataset published in 2020. The evaluation protocol uses a standard random 80/20 train-test split and ten-fold cross-validation, which does not account for the temporal nature of phishing attacks. The methodology does not incorporate any adaptive strategies (e.g., continual learning, periodic retraining) to address concept drift, nor does it argue for the use of inherently stable, drift-resilient features. The entire experimental setup assumes that the characteristics of phishing websites do not change over time, which is contrary to the premise of concept drift.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3: '80% of the dataset is used to train our model, and 20% of the dataset is used for testing to evaluate its performance.'\n\nPage 4, Section 3.1: 'In our work, a public dataset has been evaluated with a deep investigation to conclude whether it is proper to forecast future phishing attacks or not. All of the characteristics are gathered from Phishing Websites Dataset, which was published in 2020 [27].'\n\nPage 12, Section 4.2: 'The fixed conditions for all algorithms are the training and test set sizes (80% and 20%, respectively) and ten-fold cross-validation.'\n\nThis evidence collectively demonstrates that the evaluation was performed on a random split of a static, historical dataset, with no consideration for the temporal evolution of phishing attacks. The method itself is a one-time training procedure without any built-in adaptability."
