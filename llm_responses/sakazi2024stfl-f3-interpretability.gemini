    "why": "The proposed method, STFL, uses a deep learning architecture consisting of a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) autoencoder and a subsequent classification model built from fully connected layers. This type of neural network is inherently non-transparent, functioning as a \"black box.\" The paper provides no mechanism, either built-in (like an attention layer) or as a post-hoc analysis (using XAI techniques like SHAP or LIME), to explain the reasoning behind its classification for any given URL. The research focuses entirely on the novel training paradigm (federated, semi-supervised, transfer learning) and its predictive performance, without addressing the need to audit or understand individual predictions.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section V-B, \"Structure of the Bi-LSTM Classification Model\": \"shown in Fig. 2(b), a fully connected layer of 128 dimensions with Relu is added to the encoders of each model in the Bi-LSTM autoencoder network. Then all of the fully connected layers are concatenated together. Two hidden linear layers with ReLU, where the output dimensions are 64 and 32 respectively composed to the concatenated layer. The final output consists of one neuron with a Sigmoid activation function.\" This description confirms the use of a complex, multi-layered neural network which is not inherently interpretable. The paper lacks any subsequent section or discussion on methods to interpret the model's decisions."
