{"value":"High","why":"The proposed method relies on inherently stable identity-based features (visual logos and textual brand keywords), avoiding drift-prone adversarial signals, and its evaluation includes data drawn from two disjoint time periods, thus reflecting temporal dynamics.","evidence":"Section 1 (Introduction): “identity-based techniques do not depend on dynamically evolving adversarial patterns in the phishing webpage” – avoids volatile features by design. Section 4.1 (Dataset preparation): “webpage samples were downloaded from … September to December 2018 and from January to March 2020,” and performance is reported separately on these sets – evaluation on data from different time periods."}
