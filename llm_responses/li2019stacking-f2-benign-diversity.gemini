    "why": "The evaluation includes benign pages from low-reputation or long-tail domains, satisfying one of the two main criteria for diversity. Specifically, the 2K-PD dataset consists of legitimate pages from Alexa rankings between 100,000 and 101,000, which represents the long tail of the web. However, the paper provides no evidence that the benign datasets were curated to include the second key diversity aspect: pages that make legitimate use of third-party brand elements (e.g., PayPal buttons, Google/Facebook login widgets). The larger 50K datasets are also seeded from relatively popular domains (Alexa ranks 10,000-15,000) and expanded by crawling, which may not guarantee sufficient low-reputation diversity. Since only one of the two specified criteria for diversity is met, the evaluation is rated as Medium.",
