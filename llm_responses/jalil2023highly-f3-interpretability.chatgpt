{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed framework uses global feature importance (domain knowledge combined with ReliefF selection) to identify the top 30 URL-based features, but it does not provide per-instance explanations (e.g., via SHAP/LIME or decision paths) for each classification decision. Thus, it offers limited (global) insight into model behavior rather than full interpretability.","evidence":"Section 3.2.2 Feature engineering: “From out of 100 features, top 30 features are selected using domain knowledge and ReliefF technique in WEKA tool” (no per-decision XAI methods are described)"}
