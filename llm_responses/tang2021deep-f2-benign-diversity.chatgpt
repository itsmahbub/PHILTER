{"value":"Low","why":"The paper’s benign dataset consists solely of generic URLs drawn from large public repositories (PhishStorm, ISCX-URL2016, and Kaggle) with no effort to include low-reputation or long-tail domains nor pages known to embed legitimate brand elements. Thus it fails to cover either of the two “hard” benign subsets required for a robust false-positive evaluation.","evidence":"Page 5, Section III.A Data Collection Tasks: “We collected data from different open sources shown in Table 1. … We loaded around 350,000 benign URLs from an open Kaggle project [23].” (No mention of low-reputation domains or brand element usage.)"}
