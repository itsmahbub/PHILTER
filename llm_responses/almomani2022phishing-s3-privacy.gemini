    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper describes a phishing detection method based on features extracted from the URL, HTML, and JavaScript content of a webpage. It is a comparative study focused on the performance of different machine learning algorithms on static datasets. The paper does not specify a deployment architecture (e.g., client-side, server-side) or discuss how user data would be handled during a live detection/inference process. The extraction of features such as 'Links in <Meta>, <Script>and <Link>tags' and 'Website Forwarding' inherently requires access to the full webpage content. Since there is no mention of any privacy-preserving mechanisms like on-device processing, URL hashing, federated learning, or data sanitization, the method defaults to the lowest privacy category as per the codebook criteria.",
    "evidence": "Page 8, Section 3.1: 'our study focused on building semantic features based on URL & Domain Identity, Abnormal Based, HTML and JavaScript-based Features, Domain-based Features, which makes the number of features low compared with other studies and the speed of classification fast if we use any adaptive machine learning.'\n\nPage 11, Table 2: The list of 'Semantic Phishing Websites Features' includes features that require access to the page source code, such as 'Links in <Meta>, <Script>and <Link>tags' (Feature 15), 'Website Forwarding' (Feature 19), and 'IFrame Redirection' (Feature 23).\n\nThroughout the paper, particularly in the methodology (Section 3) and results (Section 4), the focus remains on the offline evaluation of classifiers. There is no section or statement describing how the system would be deployed in a user-facing environment or what measures would be taken to protect user privacy."
