{"value":"Low","why":"The method does not provide any per-decision explanations or expose its internal decision steps to users. Although it internally extracts visual regions and similarity scores, it offers only a binary classification (‘phishing’ or ‘legitimate’) based on a thresholded similarity measure, without bounding-box overlays, feature importances, or any XAI outputs that justify individual predictions.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.1: “The similarity scores are then used to generate feedback (7) about the legitimacy of the current web page.” Page 7, Section 4.4: “These approaches compare two images and give a score between 0.0 and 1.0… Logistic regression using 10-fold cross validation was used to compute the threshold for the classification.”"}
