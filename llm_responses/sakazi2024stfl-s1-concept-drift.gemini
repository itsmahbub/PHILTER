    "why": "The proposed STFL method is inherently designed to be adaptive through its use of federated learning (FL). The core idea is that local models on user devices learn from fresh, unlabeled URL data, and these learnings are aggregated on a central server, allowing the global model to be continuously updated as phishing tactics evolve. This continuous learning process is a direct strategy to combat concept drift. However, the paper's evaluation protocol does not validate this capability with a temporally aware setup. The experiments use random splits of datasets rather than training on older data and testing on newer data. The authors explicitly acknowledge this as a limitation and an area for future work, stating the need to use datasets partitioned by their temporal order. Therefore, the method employs an adaptive strategy by design but is not evaluated in a way that proves its resilience to concept drift over time.",
    "evidence": "Adaptive Strategy by Design: 'Phishing attacks are continually changing, so machine learning detection models must be continuously updated by collecting new URL data from users without compromising their privacy.' (Page 1, Abstract). The federated learning framework is presented as the solution to this problem.\n\nLack of Temporal Evaluation: 'Furthermore, phishing URLs have an explicit temporal nature. Therefore, it should use the current URLs data to train the model and detect future URLs. The datasets we used were gathered over a long period. Thus, there is a need to collect a dataset from users' entries partitioned by their temporal orders.' (Page 9, Section VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK). This statement confirms that the evaluation did not follow a temporal split protocol.\n\nEvaluation Protocol Used: 'We divided the CPURNN [3] dataset into a training and test set (90%:10%). The training set contained 1,080,000 benign URLs which were divided randomly (as commonly done in various research studies [35], [33], [57], [25]) among k participating users...' (Page 6, Section V. EVALUATION). This describes a random data split, not a temporal one."
