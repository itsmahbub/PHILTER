{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed MLSELM is a static model trained and tested on randomly split, time-agnostic datasets (UCI, Mendeley 2018, Mendeley 2020) with no temporal (train-then-test-on-newer) evaluation or any adaptive/retraining strategy to address evolving phishing tactics. Hence it assumes phishing features remain static and does not anticipate concept drift.","evidence":"Abstract (page 1): “The proposed model is evaluated with datasets from UCI (D1), Mendeley 2018 (D2) and Mendeley 2020 (D3, D4).” Section III.A (page 5): “The proposed work applied on four datasets named as D1, D2, D3, D4. D1 is collected from UCI repository and D2 from Mendeley… D3 and D4 are also collected from Mendeley…” No mention of temporal train/test splits or adaptive retraining."}
