{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper’s URL-based method explicitly incorporates features targeting multiple phishing tactics observable in URLs (typosquatting, random strings, Punycode homographs, subdomain manipulation, lexical obfuscation), fulfilling the expectation that URL-based detectors address diverse tactics. However, it does not provide any per-tactic breakdown of its evaluation results, reporting only aggregate performance.","evidence":"– Page 7, Section 4.5 (Maliciousness analysis module): “we have implemented a Maliciousness Analysis Module (MAM)… which mainly focuses on detection of Typosquatting.”\n– Page 7, Section 4.4 (Random word detection module): “we implemented the Random Word Detection Module (RWDM)” to catch randomly generated character sequences.\n– Page 10, Table 2 (NLP based features) lists ‘Random Word Count’, ‘Subdomain Count’, ‘Puny Code’ (for homograph attacks), ‘Consecutive Character Repeat’ (for lexical obfuscation), etc.\n– Page 11, Section 5.5 and Tables 4–5: overall confusion matrices and aggregate precision/recall/accuracy are given, with no breakdown by tactic category."}
