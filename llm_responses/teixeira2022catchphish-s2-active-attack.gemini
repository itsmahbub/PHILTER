    "why": "The proposed method, CatchPhish, is designed and evaluated specifically for its resistance to one type of active attack: typosquatting (a form of homographic attack). The authors demonstrate robustness by generating a synthetic dataset using ten common character manipulation techniques (e.g., inserting/omitting letters, swapping characters). The model is then trained and tested on its ability to identify these manipulated terms. This shows resilience against a specific and relevant attack vector. However, the scope of this resistance is limited. The paper explicitly states that other forms of textual evasion, such as using synonyms or keywords to refer to a brand, are not handled by the current model and are considered future work. Therefore, the method is robust against a subset of active attacks within its modality (lexical analysis) but does not address the full surface of textual attacks.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section III-A, Construction of the database: \"With the target brands already defined and seeking to build a self-sufficient model in the generation of databases, capable of generalizing the identification of the selected brands, it was proposed to build an application capable of elaborating distorted terms (typosquatting) referring to the selected brands. such as “amoz0n”, “ltau”, “yah00”. In this process, ten characteristics already observed and discussed in the literature [19] were applied. These are: #01. Insert Neighbor Key Letter on Keyboard... #10. TLD simulation...\"\n\nPage 8, Section VI, CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK: \"As a future work, it is intended to apply terms that make indirect mention of the target brand, such as through synonyms or keywords, in order to bring CatchPhish closer to the real behavior of phishing attacks.\""
