{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates PhishNot only on clean, static URL data drawn from standard phishing and benign datasets, without any tests involving adversarial manipulations or evasion techniques (e.g. URL obfuscation with junk characters, unicode homographs, dynamic content loading, deferred execution, or cloaking). There is no discussion or experimentation demonstrating robustness against active attacks within its URL‐only scope.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 5.3 “Dataset preprocessing”: “The dataset chosen to train and test our models was the one introduced in [22]. The dataset was built by collecting data about well‐known phishing URLs from PhishTank [23] and benign URLs from Alexa [24].”  No further evaluation of adversarial or evasive manipulations is described."}
