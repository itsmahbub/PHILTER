{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method is a pure black-box classifier: it focuses exclusively on maximizing classification accuracy and does not provide any per-decision explanations (e.g., via SHAP/LIME or attention/gradient heatmaps), global feature importance analysis, or inherently transparent decision paths.","evidence":"Page 1, Abstract: “Finally, the trained classifier can give a high-accuracy result for an unknown website URL.” (no mention of explanations) ; Page 8, Section 4.2: Description of input, attention, feature and output blocks, ending with “Finally, the output block gives the detection result,” without any interpretability or explanation mechanism."}
