{"value": "Low", "why": "WebPhish neither incorporates any explicit adaptation mechanism for concept drift (e.g., continual or periodic retraining, time-aware feature updates), nor does it evaluate resilience over temporally separated data. The model is trained and tested via randomized K-fold cross-validation on a static dataset drawn from the same time period, implicitly assuming phishing tactics remain unchanged.", "evidence": "Page 6, Section 4.2: “Subsequently, our final corpus contained a balanced dataset of 45,373 phishing and benign instances.”\nPage 7–8, Section 4.4: “We evaluated the machine learning model’s performance using the K-fold cross-validation technique with k set to 5.”"}
