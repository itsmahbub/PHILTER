    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper's proposed method, PhishBERT, is designed with features that could inherently address concept drift. The pre-training on a massive, diverse corpus of over 3 billion URLs is intended to help the model learn general, stable syntactic and semantic properties of URLs, rather than relying on volatile, easily changed lexical features. More explicitly, during the fine-tuning phase, the authors use a specific regularization technique with the stated goal of \"strengthening the stationarity of the model,\" which is a direct attempt to make the model robust against distribution shifts, the statistical underpinning of concept drift. \n\nHowever, the evaluation protocol does not validate this capability against a temporal drift scenario. The paper describes collecting phishing data \"before April 2022\" but does not mention splitting this data chronologically for training and testing (e.g., training on 2021 data and testing on 2022 data). The experiments focus on robustness against small training sets and few training epochs, not against the evolution of phishing tactics over time. Therefore, while the method is designed to be robust, this robustness to concept drift is not empirically demonstrated through a time-aware evaluation.",
    "evidence": "Design for robustness: \"Therefore, we apply a regularization technique [13], to improve the robustness and effectiveness of fine-tuning. Specifically, this regularization technique consists of two important components: 1) Using smoothness inductive adversarial regularization to effectively control the extremely high complexity of the model, strengthening the stationarity of the model.\" (Page 2, Section 2.5, Fine-tuning PhishBERT)\n\nLack of temporal evaluation: \"We extract phishing URL data from PhishTank, an open service for sharing and validating phishing URLs. We scraped 2.19 million pieces of data from Phishtank before April 2022, and for this experiment we sampled 200,000 verified phishing URLs.\" (Page 3, Section 3.2, Experimental Data). The subsequent sections on experimental setup and results do not mention a temporal split of this dataset."
