{"value":"Medium","why":"While the authors go to considerable length to collect and test against ‘misleading legitimacies’—i.e. benign pages embedding social-media buttons, OAuth widgets and brand logos—they do not include any dedicated set of low-reputation or long-tail domains (e.g. recently registered personal sites or small regional businesses).
