    "why": "The evaluation includes both required forms of diversity for benign webpages. \n\nFirst, it explicitly tests on low-reputation and long-tail domains by creating a dedicated dataset (Dataset 3) of 500 \"unpopular legitimate webpages.\" The paper specifies that these sites were sourced from multiple directories (Alexa, dmoz.org, botw.org), are ranked low in Alexa (1001-5150), and include 82 sites not even ranked in the top one million. \n\nSecond, it addresses pages with legitimate brand element usage. The paper discusses its capability to handle sites with multiple logos, specifically citing the example of a legitimate page that allows users to log in with various social network IDs (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter), which is a common source of false positives for other methods. The methodology is designed to correctly classify these pages, implying their inclusion in the test set.",
    "evidence": "For low-reputation domains (Dataset 3):\n- Page 7, Section 3.3: \"We also constructed an additional dataset 3, which consists of 500 other unpopular legitimate webpages. In addition to http:// www.alexa.com, we also obtained the webpages from http:// www.dmoz.org and http://botw.org.\"\n- Page 7, Section 3.3: \"The purpose of dataset 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in some very challenging situations, namely the very unpopular legitimate webpages. They are ranked between 1001 to 5150 in Alexa and 16.4 percent of them (82 webpages) are not ranked in the Alexa top one million websites.\"\n\nFor legitimate brand element usage:\n- Page 10, Section 5: \"It is also noteworthy to mention that our proposed method is capable of handling a webpage with multiple logos, which appears to be a difficult problem for an anti-phishing technique using the textual element. For instance, some websites allow users to login with multiple social network IDs as shown in Fig. 6. In this case, the website contains multiple logos on the webpage (i.e., logo of the website and logos of the social networks).\""
