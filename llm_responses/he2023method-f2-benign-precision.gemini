    "why": "The paper sources its data from a public Kaggle dataset, described simply as containing \"legal URL samples.\" There is no information provided about the composition or diversity of these benign URLs. The evaluation does not mention or demonstrate the inclusion of specific challenging benign subsets, such as low-reputation or long-tail domains (e.g., personal blogs, small businesses, newly registered sites) or pages that make legitimate use of brand elements (e.g., PayPal payment buttons, Google login widgets). The lack of detail on the benign dataset's diversity means the evaluation is limited to an uncharacterized set of popular or common websites, failing to meet the criteria for a Medium or High rating.",
