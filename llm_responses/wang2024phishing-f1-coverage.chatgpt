{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method focuses exclusively on visual similarity (full-page and logo features) and does not consider or evaluate multiple phishing tactics (e.g. subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, use of IP‐based URLs, lexical manipulations, hosting on shared domains, HTTPS misuse, etc.). The evaluation reports only overall precision/recall/F1 over brand‐targeted datasets, with no per‐tactic breakdown or discussion of tactic diversity coverage.","evidence":"Section 2 (Related work) and Section 4.1 (Datasets and metrics) describe visual similarity datasets and overall performance metrics (precision, recall, F1) but do not categorize or report results by phishing tactic. No mention of URL‐based evasions or host‐environment tactics is made in the methodology or evaluation."}
