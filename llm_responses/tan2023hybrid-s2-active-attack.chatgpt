{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates detection accuracy only on clean phishing and legitimate webpage samples without testing any deliberate evasive or adversarial manipulations (e.g. junk HTML, cloaking, deferred execution, adversarial perturbations) against the proposed system.","evidence":"Page 11, Section 4.1 (“…webpage samples were downloaded…from PhishTank and OpenPhish archive. The downloaded webpage samples were then filtered…”), and Section 4.3 (“Results showed that the proposed technique…achieved 99.40% TPR and 97.80% TNR”) – no experiments involving active evasion techniques are described."}
