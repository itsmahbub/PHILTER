{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper considers multiple phishing tactics—such as hosting on free subdomains, cloud services, fake form platforms, social media/malware blogs, and standalone or compromised domains—by performing a domain-frequency analysis that identifies six distinct hosting strategies. However, it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of detection performance per tactic; instead it only reports overall URL-based detection accuracy.","evidence":"Page 3, Section III (“we perform a frequency analysis over current phishing domains to identify different techniques… We found six different phishing domains depending on the service hired by the attacker.”); Page 10, Table 8 (listing the six phishing domain categories), with no per-category performance metrics reported."}
