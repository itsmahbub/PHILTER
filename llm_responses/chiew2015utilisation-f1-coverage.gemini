    "why": "The proposed method is largely tactic-agnostic by design. Its core mechanism involves verifying the consistency between a website's visual identity (the logo) and its network identity (the domain name). This approach is inherently resilient to a variety of common phishing tactics that rely on impersonation and obfuscation, such as hosting on compromised domains, using trusted third-party hosting, or employing URL manipulations (subdomain spoofing, lexical variations). The method's effectiveness does not depend on URL syntax or hosting provider reputation but on the fundamental link between a brand's logo and its official domain, which is crowdsourced via Google Image Search. Furthermore, the authors explicitly consider the tactic of impersonating less popular brands by creating and testing a specific dataset (\"dataset 3\") of \"unpopular legitimate webpages\" to challenge their system. However, the evaluation does not meet the 'High' criteria. While the phishing dataset is sourced from PhishTank, which contains diverse examples, the paper does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the tactics present in the dataset, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. The evaluation is presented in aggregate, preventing a detailed understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses against specific attack vectors.",
    "evidence": "Page 22, Section 3.3, Experimental results: \"The main objective of the method is to determine the identity of the phishing target when a phishing webpage is detected... Immediate comparison between the domain name of the determined identity with the one from the query website will enable us to differentiate a phishing from a legitimate website.\" This describes the core tactic-agnostic mechanism.\n\nPage 22, Section 3.3, Experimental results: \"We also constructed an additional dataset 3, which consists of 500 other unpopular legitimate webpages. In addition to http://www.alexa.com, we also obtained the webpages from http://www.dmoz.org and http://botw.org... The purpose of dataset 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in some very challenging situations, namely the very unpopular legitimate webpages.\" This demonstrates consideration for the tactic of targeting less popular brands.\n\nPage 22, Section 3.3, Experimental results: \"Phishing webpages are downloaded from PhishTank and legitimate webpages are from Alexa within different categories (i.e., banking, social networking, news, e-commerce, forums and blogging).\" This describes the dataset source but lacks a breakdown by specific phishing tactics. The results in Figures 3 and 4 present only aggregate metrics (TPr, TNr, FPr, FNr) without any per-tactic analysis."
