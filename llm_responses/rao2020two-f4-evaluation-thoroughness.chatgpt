{"value":"High","why":"The paper’s evaluation reports key class-sensitive metrics—Precision, Recall (TPR), and F1-score—alongside the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as a summary metric, satisfying the ‘High’ criterion for comprehensive evaluation under class imbalance.","evidence":"Section 4.3 “Evaluation and metrics”: “We have used ... Precision (Pre), F1 score (F) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate the performance of our model.”; Table 9 (p. 16) lists TPR, Precision, F-measure and MCC for classifiers."}
