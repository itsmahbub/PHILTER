    "why": "The proposed method, PhishFencing, is explicitly designed to be resilient to concept drift by selecting features that are inherently more stable over time. The authors argue that visual identity (logos) and network identity (hosting features like IP prefix, AS number) are more robust and harder for attackers to manipulate compared to volatile features like URLs or HTML content. Furthermore, the system includes an adaptive mechanism to autonomously refresh its database of legitimate logos using search engines, which allows it to keep up with changes in branding. However, the experimental evaluation does not validate this long-term resilience. The dataset was collected over a short, continuous 7-day period, and the paper does not describe a temporal split (e.g., training on older data, testing on newer data) to demonstrate performance against evolving phishing tactics. Therefore, while the method's design addresses concept drift, its evaluation lacks the temporal rigor to fully prove it.",
