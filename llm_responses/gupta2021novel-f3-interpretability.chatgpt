{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed approach provides global interpretability by reporting overall feature importance scores (via Spearman correlation, K-best, and Random Forest importance), but it does not offer per-instance explanations (e.g., no SHAP/LIME outputs or explicit decision paths for each URL).","evidence":"Section 3.3 (pp. 50–51): “we applied different algorithms, such as Spearman correlation, K best, and Random forest, and calculated feature importance scores.”; Section 4.4 (p. 53, Fig. 9): displays global feature importance rankings without per-decision traceability."}
