    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method is a hybrid voting ensemble (LSD) that combines Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, and a Decision Tree (DT). A Decision Tree is an inherently interpretable model, as its decision paths can be traced to understand a classification. The paper also evaluates the Decision Tree as a standalone model. However, the authors do not leverage or discuss this interpretability. The evaluation focuses exclusively on performance metrics like accuracy and precision, with no mention of visualizing the tree, exposing decision paths, or even providing global feature importance scores. According to the codebook, using an inherently interpretable model without providing per-decision traceability meets the criteria for a \"Medium\" rating. The potential for interpretation exists due to the model choice, but it is not implemented or discussed.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section III (MATERIAL AND METHODS): \"Multiple machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree (DT), linear regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector classifier (SVC), K-neighbors classifier, and the proposed hybrid model (LR+SVC+DT) LSD with soft and hard voting were used based on functional features...\"\n\nPage 10, Section IV.A (EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF DECISION TREE): \"The decision tree algorithm depends on tree-based architecture, which consists of several internal nodes and leaves that carry data according to the patterns found in the dataset... Table 2. shows the results of the decision tree with different numbers of max_depth such as 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30. An increase in the depth of the tree increases the accuracy and other results of the model.\" (Note: The entire section evaluates the DT based on performance metrics, without any discussion of its explanatory power)."
