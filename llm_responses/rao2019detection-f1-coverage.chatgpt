{"value":"Medium","why":"The method incorporates multiple URL‐based phishing tactics—including misuse of HTTPS (UF5), IP‐address URLs (UF4), subdomain obfuscation (UF1, UF3), and lexical tricks such as the ‘@’ symbol (UF2)—showing that it addresses a variety of phishing strategies. However, the authors do not provide any quantitative breakdown of their evaluation dataset by tactic nor report per‐tactic detection performance, which is required for a High rating.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 3.1.1 (features UF1–UF5 describe subdomain spoofing, long URLs, IP‐address URLs, @ symbol, HTTPS misuse); Page 17, Table 4 (only overall accuracy and no per‐tactic performance breakdown)"}
