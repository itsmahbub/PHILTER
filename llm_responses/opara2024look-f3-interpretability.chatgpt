{"value":"Low","why":"WebPhish is presented as a pure deep neural network that processes raw URL and HTML embeddings through convolutional and fully-connected layers to output a sigmoid score, with no mechanism for per-decision or global interpretability. The paper does not describe any explainability or post hoc XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention heatmaps), nor does it report feature importances or expose decision paths of an interpretable model.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.4 (“The CNN consists of two major operations: convolution and pooling…”) and Section 3.6 (“The output layer… computes the model’s result using the sigmoid function.”) give detailed network architecture but make no reference to interpretability. Page 8, Section 5 (“We evaluated the performance of WebPhish using Recall…Precision…Accuracy…F1 score…”) shows only black-box performance metrics."}
