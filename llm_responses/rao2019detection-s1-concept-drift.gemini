    "why": "The paper proposes a static detection model based on a fixed set of heuristic features. There are no mechanisms discussed for adapting to concept drift, such as online learning or periodic retraining. The features, while designed to capture then-current phishing characteristics, are not inherently stable and are susceptible to changes in attacker tactics (e.g., the use of HTTPS, which the paper acknowledges is no longer a reliable indicator). \n\nThe evaluation methodology reinforces this static approach. The dataset was split randomly into training and testing sets, rather than chronologically. This means the model was not tested on its ability to generalize from older data to newer, potentially different, phishing attacks. Consequently, the paper neither employs an adaptive design nor evaluates the method's resilience to the evolution of phishing strategies over time.",
