    "why": "The paper explicitly designs its method, PhishingRTDS, to detect a diverse set of phishing tactics, including URL shortening (TinyURLs), content-based attacks like Browser in the Browser (BiTB), and what it terms \"regular phishing attacks\". The methodology reflects this by incorporating a browser extension to resolve shortened URLs, a sandboxed container to safely scrape webpage content for embedded URLs (specifically targeting IFrames used in BiTB), and a deep learning model that analyzes URL strings. The authors also note their dataset includes attacks that abuse subdomains. This demonstrates a clear consideration for tactic diversity. However, the evaluation falls short of the \"High\" criteria because it does not provide a quantitative breakdown of the different attack types within its evaluation dataset, nor does it report detection performance on a per-tactic basis. The results are aggregated, preventing a clear assessment of the method's effectiveness against each specific tactic it was designed to counter.",
    "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"In this paper, we design a system that detects three types of phishing attacks: Tiny Uniform Resource Locators (TinyURLs), Browsers in the Browser (BiTB), and regular phishing attacks.\"\nPage 4, Section 3.1.1, Browser extension: \"Once a user clicks on a URL, the extension extracts the original webpage’s URL. This step protects the user from TinyURL attacks.\"\nPage 5, Section 3.2, Data Extraction: \"Since the BiTB attacks use IFrame, we propose scrapping all URLs inside the webpage. So, we use three methods to scrape all URLs inside the webpage: Frame source such as (Frame, Inline Frame (IFrame), JFrame), href attribute, and URL regular expression.\"\nPage 7, Section 4.1, Data collection: \"They contain phishing attacks that rely on abusing the subdomain with a random word, and some URLs are small URLs that the hostname itself is a phishing URL.\"\nPage 9, Table 3: The performance table shows aggregated results for the proposed methods (SPhS, MSS, WeAS), but does not offer a breakdown of performance against specific attack tactics like TinyURL or BiTB."
