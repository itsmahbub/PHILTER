    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The core of the proposed detection method relies on sending extracted logo images, which are a form of webpage content, to an external third-party service (Google Image Search) for inference. The paper explicitly states that it uses Google's content-based image retrieval feature to determine the website's identity. This process involves transmitting a key graphical element from the user's queried webpage to an external server. The paper does not describe any privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as hashing, anonymization, or client-side privacy safeguards, to protect user data during this external communication. This direct transmission of webpage content to an external service for analysis aligns with the criteria for a low privacy preservation rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.2, Identity verification: \"Hence, we utilise Google Images as a source of the knowledge database. To fully utilise the Google Images database, we employed the content-based image retrieval feature from the Google image search facility. It allowed us to retrieve the portrayed identity of a query website from the vast image database. This is depicted as a Google image search subprocess in Fig. 1.\"\nPage 5, Fig. 1: The diagram \"Framework of the proposed method\" clearly shows a step labeled \"Google Image Search\" that takes the output of the local \"Logo Detection\" and passes it to an external service before the local \"Domain Comparison\" step."
