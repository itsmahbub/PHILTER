{"value":"High","why":"The paper clearly describes a privacy-preserving, on-device inference design: the CNN phishing detector is optimized for mobile devices, runs locally to check each URL in about two milliseconds, and no raw URLs (with potential session tokens or personal identifiers) are transmitted off-device for classification. Model updates (training) pull only aggregated phishing/legitimate datasets periodically; this occurs outside the user’s real-time URL checking loop and does not involve user-specific URLs.","evidence":"Page 2, Abstract: “The network we present is appropriately optimised so that it can be used even on mobile devices without significantly affecting its performance.”\nPage 5, Section 4.3: “We want to optimize the architecture presented by us so that the network can be implemented in mobile devices with limited memory and computing power.”\nPage 6, Figure 7 and caption: “Sequence diagram of the proposed method. Upon the HTTP request from the client, the system checks the URL and decides if it can be requested.… Every day the system monitors if there are new phishing addresses … and trains the model …” (inference loop is self-contained on the client).\nPage 7, Section 6: “The trained phishing detector is small and fast and can be used effortlessly on mobile devices. … URL checking [takes] about two milliseconds.”"}
