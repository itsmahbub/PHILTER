{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed method relies on a single publicly-available dataset of phishing and legitimate sites described only by numerical URL and domain features and reports only overall performance metrics. It does not identify or evaluate against specific phishing tactics (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, URL redirection, shared hosting), nor does it provide any per-tactic breakdown of results. The evaluation dataset itself contains no information on tactic diversity.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.1 “The dataset has 88,647 instances with 111 features and a labeled output column. According to Fig. 3, the number of non-phishing instances (0) is 58,000, and the number of phishing ones (1) is 30,647... Moreover, the dataset neither does contain any categorical variables nor null values.”; Page 15, Section 4.2 “As a result of balancing the dataset, 95,577 instances were identified... In our simulations, the XGBoost classifier outperformed the other classifiers in the classification of phishing websites, with 99.22% overall accuracy.”"}
