{"value":"High","why":"The paper reports class-sensitive metrics—precision, recall, and F1-score—and also provides a summary metric (AUC of the ROC curve). This fulfills the high standard of Evaluation Quality by demonstrating both class-specific performance and an overall measure appropriate for imbalanced phishing detection.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 4.1: “To evaluate the proposed model, the following metrics are introduced: precision, recall (true positive rate), F1 score, matching accuracy, false positive rate (FPR), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under curve (AUC).”; Page 7, Section 4.3, Table 8: Comparison results include columns Pre, Rec, F1, FPR, and AUC (Our model achieves AUC = 0.86)."}
