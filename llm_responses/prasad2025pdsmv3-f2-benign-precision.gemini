    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper's evaluation relies on datasets where the benign URLs are either sourced from high-reputation lists or their diversity is not described. Specifically, the Mendeley_2020 dataset explicitly sources benign URLs from \"Alexa rankings,\" which consists of popular, well-established websites. This directly contradicts the requirement to include low-reputation or long-tail domains. For other datasets like Phishstorm, benign URLs are sourced from the general (and now defunct) \"Open Directory Project,\" with no mention of specific inclusion of low-reputation sites. The paper does not provide any evidence that the benign sets were curated to include either (i) low-reputation/long-tail domains or (ii) pages with legitimate use of brand elements (e.g., PayPal widgets, social media logins). The evaluation is therefore limited to high-reputation or general sites, failing to test the model's robustness against more challenging, real-world benign cases that often cause false positives.",
    "evidence": "Page 9, Section 4.2.3, \"Mendeley_2020 dataset (Mendeley)... Information was acquired from PhishTank and Alexa rankings.\"\n\nPage 9, Section 4.2.4, \"Phishstorm (C. Kaggle)... In contrast to the Phishstorm dataset, which underwent class sampling, PhishTank does not offer a benign URL. From the Open Directory Project, we gathered benign URLs...\"\n\nPage 9, Sections 4.2.1 & 4.2.2, The descriptions for the ISCX-URL and URL-Based phishing datasets are generic and do not specify the source or characteristics of the benign URLs, simply stating they contain \"reputable\" or \"benign\" URLs."
