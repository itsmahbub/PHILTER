{"value":"Medium","why":"CANTINA+ employs a broad set of URL-based (e.g. IP address URLs, subdomain/TLD misuse, embedded domains, sensitive keywords) and content-/web-based features (e.g. WHOIS age, PageRank, search-engine consistency) that cover multiple common phishing tactics. However, the evaluation (Sections 7–8) uses mixed corpora without categorizing attacks by tactic and does not report per-tactic performance metrics, so it lacks the required quantitative breakdown to qualify as High.","evidence":"Section 6.1 (features 1–6 cover IP addresses, embedded domains, out-of-position TLDs; features 7–10 cover form and link anomalies; features 11–15 cover WHOIS age, PageRank, search consistency), and Section 8 (evaluation on mixed corpora with 8118 phish and 4883 legitimate pages but no per-tactic breakdown or performance reported by tactic)."}
