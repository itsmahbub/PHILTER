    "why": "The proposed method, Protective Operation Chain (POC), is explicitly designed to obfuscate the features used by the phishing detector. The core mechanism involves creating a new, complex feature space by randomly combining original features using non-linear and arithmetic operators (e.g., sin, log, +, *). The paper states that a primary goal of this transformation is to make the model's logic harder for an adversary to understand or reverse-engineer. This intentional obfuscation makes the resulting model a black box by design, as the connection between the original, human-understandable features (like URL length or domain age) and the final prediction is obscured. The paper offers no mechanism, such as post-hoc XAI techniques, to explain or audit individual classification decisions.",
    "evidence": "page 6, section 5, \"Simply put, the POC algorithm obfuscates the features used by a PD so that an adversary cannot easily tell what the PD is doing and, hence, offensively react to such PD.\"\n\npage 7, section 5.2, \"The first goal is achieved by randomly using the old features (F) to create a new feature space (Ψ) which makes it harder to reverse-engineer (or ‘steal’ [83]) the classifier used by the PD (e.g., the attack against the Google Chrome filter [76]).\"\n\npage 6, section 5.1, \"Suppose F is the list of features shown in Table 2 and suppose F' consists of any two of these features, e.g., F' = {f1, f2}. Then examples of operation chains based on F' and on the proposed set of Fmop include: ... 3) sin(f1)+cos(f2) is an oc that generates a new feature that creates feature values by summing up the sine of the value of feature f1 and the cosine of the value of feature f2. This oc has size 3.\""
