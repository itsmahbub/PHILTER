{"value":"Medium","why":"The method is evaluated against adversarial perturbations (salt & pepper noise and FGSM white-box attacks) observable in its screenshot modality, demonstrating partial robustness after fine-tuning. However, no evaluations are reported for other active evasions relevant to screenshots (e.g. invisible elements, cloaking, dynamic/AJAX-loaded content), so robustness is shown only for a subset of active attacks.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 4.4 (“Adversarial defense”): “Salt and pepper noise… The matching accuracy of the proposed model decreases by 0.48% and 2.23% for 0.01% and 0.02% noise… the model is robust against the salt and pepper noise attack.”  “FGSM… the matching accuracy decreases by 9.54% and 19.3%… after retraining… decreases by 0.70% and 4.45%… Therefore, the model is robust to adversarial samples generated by FGSM after fine-tuning.”"}
