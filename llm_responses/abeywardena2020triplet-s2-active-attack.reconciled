{"value":"Low","why":"Although the authors assert that a screenshot-based approach is ‘resilient to code obfuscation,’ they provide no experimental validation against any active evasion techniques (e.g. injected junk HTML, dynamic content loading, cloaking, adversarial visual perturbations) within their screenshot modality. All evaluations are conducted on clean phishing versus benign screenshots (PhishTank and Alexa datasets) without any adversarial or evasive manipulations. Under the codebook’s criteria, absence of any active-attack tests merits a ‘Low’ rating.","evidence":"Page 1, Section I: “Since our method does not rely on text and code features, it is resilient to code obfuscation.”; Pages 3–4, Section V: evaluation reports precision/recall only on PhishTank/Alexa screenshots, with no active attack scenarios tested."}
