    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation using metrics appropriate for class-imbalanced datasets. It consistently reports class-sensitive metrics—Precision, Recall, and F-Score—across numerous tables comparing different classifiers, configurations, and detection methods. Furthermore, it includes a Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) and explicitly refers to the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as a summary metric for comparing the overall performance of different methods. This dual focus on both class-specific performance and a summary metric like AUC-PRC aligns perfectly with the criteria for a high-quality evaluation.",
    "evidence": "Page 16, Table 15 – The comparison of different detection methods or processes: This table provides a detailed breakdown of performance, including columns for \"Accuracy (%)\", \"Recall (%)\", \"F-Score (%)\", and \"Precision (%)\".\n\nPage 17, Figure 6 and accompanying text: \"Fig. 6 shows the PRC comparison of the four detection methods, which indicates that the SHLR has the largest area under the curve (AUC).\" This demonstrates the use of a Precision-Recall Curve and its corresponding Area Under the Curve as a summary performance metric."
