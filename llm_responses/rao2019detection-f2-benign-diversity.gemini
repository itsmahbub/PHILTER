    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The evaluation relies exclusively on high-reputation, popular websites for its benign dataset, which does not meet the criteria for medium or high diversity. The paper explicitly states that the 1,407 legitimate sites were collected from \"Alexa's top websites.\" This approach fails to test the model's robustness against common false positive triggers found in less conventional but perfectly legitimate websites. Specifically, the evaluation lacks both key diversity subsets: (i) low-reputation or long-tail domains (e.g., personal blogs, small business sites, newly registered domains) and (ii) a curated set of pages that make legitimate use of third-party brand elements (e.g., a small shop using a PayPal payment widget). By focusing only on top-ranked sites, the reported false positive rate is likely underestimated, as it excludes benign pages that are most susceptible to misclassification.",
    "evidence": "Page 15, Section 4.2 Dataset used and Table 2: The paper specifies the source of the benign dataset. The text states: \"we collected ... 1407 legitimate sites from Alexa Database, as shown in Table 2.\" Table 2 further clarifies the source for these legitimate sites as \"Alexa's top websites\" and provides the URL \"http://www.alexa.com/topsites\"."
