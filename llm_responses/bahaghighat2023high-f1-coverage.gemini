    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper treats phishing as a monolithic category, focusing on optimizing a machine learning pipeline (data balancing, feature dropping, algorithm comparison) on a pre-existing dataset. The methodology does not acknowledge or discuss the diversity of tactics employed by attackers. The authors use a public dataset with 111 URL-based features but do not analyze or report on the distribution of different phishing strategies within it (e.g., subdomain spoofing, lexical manipulation, HTTPS misuse). Consequently, the evaluation is entirely aggregate, presenting overall performance metrics like accuracy and precision without any breakdown of the model's effectiveness against specific tactics. This approach directly aligns with the 'Low' criteria, as it ignores tactic diversity and uses an evaluation dataset with no provided information on this aspect.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.1. Dataset: \"In our work, a public dataset has been evaluated with a deep investigation to conclude whether it is proper to forecast future phishing attacks or not. All of the characteristics are gathered from Phishing Websites Dataset, which was published in 2020 [27]. The dataset has 88,647 instances with 111 features and a labeled output column. According to Fig. 3, the number of non-phishing instances (0) is 58,000, and the number of phishing ones (1) is 30,647.\" This section describes the dataset only in terms of the number of phishing versus legitimate instances, with no mention of tactic diversity.\n\nPage 12, Section 4.2. Examined scenarios: The paper defines eight evaluation scenarios based on data processing choices: \"In our study, various algorithms... are examined in different scenarios depending on a balanced/imbalanced dataset, dropping/not dropping constant features, and with/without dimension reduction. According to Table 6, this can lead to eight distinct scenarios in our experiments:\"\n\nPages 14-15, Tables 10-15 & Conclusion: The evaluation and results are presented as aggregate performance scores across the entire test set. For instance, the conclusion summarizes the best model's performance without any tactical nuance: \"In our simulations, the XGBoost classifier outperformed the other classifiers in the classification of phishing websites, with 99.1% precision, 99.4% recall, 99.2% F1 score, 99.1% specificity, and 99.22% overall accuracy rate.\""
