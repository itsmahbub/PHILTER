    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The proposed method is rated 'Medium' because it is explicitly designed to be resilient to concept drift by relying on inherently stable features, but its evaluation protocol does not empirically verify this resilience over time. The approach is centered on 'identity-based detection', which capitalizes on fundamental brand identity (logos, brand names) rather than volatile, adversarial features that are prone to drift. The authors state that this makes the technique robust in a 'rapidly changing phishing landscape'. However, the evaluation does not fully satisfy the criteria for a 'High' rating. While the dataset was collected from two distinct and disjoint time periods (2018 and 2020), the experimental setup does not use a temporal split (e.g., training/developing on the older data and testing on the newer data) to explicitly measure the method's performance degradation or stability over time. The claim of resilience is based on the method's design principle rather than a time-aware empirical validation.",
    "evidence": "For relying on stable features: 'Since identity-based techniques do not depend on dynamically evolving adversarial patterns in the phishing webpage, it has consistently achieved superior performance in terms of phishing identification (i.e., high true positive rate).' (Page 2, Section 2)\n\nFor the evaluation protocol: 'the webpage samples were downloaded from two disjoint periods, namely, from September to December 2018 and from January to March 2020.' (Page 11, Section 4.1). The subsequent evaluation sections (4.3-4.5) describe experiments comparing performance on different datasets and against other methods, but do not mention a temporal split to test for concept drift."
