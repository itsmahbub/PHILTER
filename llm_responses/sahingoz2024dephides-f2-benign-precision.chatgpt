{"value":"Low","why":"The legitimate dataset is drawn exclusively from the top 100,000 PageRank domains (i.e. high-reputation, popular sites) without any inclusion of long-tail/low-reputation domains or pages specifically chosen for legitimate brand-element usage. There is no mention of recently registered or small/regional domains, nor of OAuth widgets or embedded logos in benign pages.","evidence":"Section IV.A Dataset Collection (page 8059): “To compile the legitimate URL dataset, the first 100,000 domains from PageRank rankings worldwide… For each of these domains, approximately 30 random URLs were selected.” No discussion of low-reputation domains or brand-element pages."}
