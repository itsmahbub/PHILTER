    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation using metrics well-suited for the class-imbalanced problem of phishing detection. The authors explicitly state they use True Positive (TP) rate (recall) and False Positive (FP) rate as their main metrics. They also report the F1-score, which combines precision and recall into a single value. Furthermore, they utilize the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) as a summary metric, particularly for model tuning and for evaluating the individual contribution of each feature. This combination of class-sensitive metrics (TP/recall, F1) and a standard summary metric (AUC-ROC) fulfills the criteria for a high-quality evaluation.",
    "evidence": "page 11, section 7.1, \"In our experiment, we adopted true positive rate and false positive rate as the main evaluation metrics, which are the standard metrics in evaluating anti-phishing techniques. We also used the F1 measure, which integrates both TP and FP with equal weights into one summary statistic. In tuning the machine learning models, we adopted the concept of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves [Fawcett 2006] and employed the area under the ROC curve (AUC) [Cortes and Mohri 2003] metric...\"\npage 15, Table IV, The main performance table reports columns for \"TP (%)\", \"FP (%)\", and \"F1\".\npage 20, Figure 4, The figure and its caption explicitly show the use of AUC to evaluate individual features: \"Fig. 4.
