{"value":"Medium","why":"The paper provides global interpretability tools—such as correlation matrices, PCA visualizations, silhouette scores, and discussion of how ensemble features relate to phishing characteristics—but does not supply per-decision explanations (e.g. SHAP/LIME attributions, attention heatmaps tied to individual predictions or a transparent decision path). Thus it offers insight into overall feature relevance (global interpretability) without traceability for each classification, fitting the “Medium” level.","evidence":"Section IV.C (Interpretability Measures): “The PCA transformation, cluster assessment, and binary encoding processes also help to improve the interpretability of the model’s conclusions.” Figures 6–10 (correlation matrices) and Figure 13 (PCA plot) demonstrate only global insights rather than per-decision explanations."}
