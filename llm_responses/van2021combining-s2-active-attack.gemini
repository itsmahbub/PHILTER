    "why": "The paper's proposed method, which analyzes a rendered screenshot of a webpage, is explicitly designed to be robust against a specific subset of active attacks. The authors identify the limitations of text-based and resource-based methods, particularly against evasions like replacing brand names with images, splitting images into multiple parts, or using pure CSS to render images. By analyzing the final visual output, the method is inherently resilient to these source-code-level obfuscation techniques. However, the paper does not demonstrate or evaluate robustness against a more diverse set of active attacks relevant to its modality. It does not address dynamic evasions where content is loaded or rendered only after user interaction (deferred execution), nor does it consider cloaking (serving different content to detectors vs. users) or adversarial perturbations designed to fool image similarity classifiers. Therefore, it demonstrates robustness against a significant but incomplete subset of the relevant attack surface.",
    "evidence": "page 4, section 3.1, 'By relying on a screenshot of the web page (rather than relying only on features extracted from the web page), our approach is robust against resource evasion techniques, such as image splitting (Fig. 2) or the replacement of image resources by pure CSS.'\npage 3, section 2.2, 'However, the brand name cannot be detected using Liu’s or any text-based approach when the brand name occurs only in embedded objects and images, as it is the case for the web page in Fig. 1.'\npage 3, section 2.2, 'For instance, images can be decomposed into several parts and then displayed as if they belong to a single image; a reverse image search on each part might not allow finding the legitimate page. Fig. 2 shows an example of splitting image resources. Moreover, an adversary could convert images to pure cascading style sheets (CSS) [7] which results in no resources for reverse image lookup.'"
