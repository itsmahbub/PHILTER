{"value":"Medium","why":"The proposed URL-based method employs multiple lexical tactics (e.g. tiny‐URL detection, brand‐matching, suspicious‐word lists, subdomain length, delimiters, hyphens, entropy) indicating it addresses more than one phishing strategy, but the paper does not provide any quantitative breakdown of its evaluation by tactic nor report per‐tactic performance.","evidence":"Table 3 (p. 9241) lists diverse URL‐based features (tiny_url, brand_host, suspwords_url, etc.), yet Sections 4.1–4.6 (pp. 9245–9249) and their result tables only give overall detection metrics on each dataset with no per‐tactic performance reporting."}
