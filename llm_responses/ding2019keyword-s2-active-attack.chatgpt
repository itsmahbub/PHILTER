{"value":"Medium","why":"The SHLR method is explicitly designed to detect URL‐level obfuscation (e.g. junk characters, hidden brand-name inserts, IP-as-domain, protocol injections) and employs static HTML features (meta refresh, anomalous <a> and <link> tags) together with an LR classifier. However, it neither evaluates nor defends against other active evasions observable in webpages—such as obfuscated JavaScript, junk or invisible HTML elements, Base64-encoded scripts, dynamic/AJAX content loading, deferred execution or cloaking—so its robustness is limited to a subset of active attacks within its claimed input scope.","evidence":"Page 263 §3.2 (“Pattern matching through strings can detect URL obfuscation techniques… We propose Rules 1–7”) and Page 264 §3.3.2 (HTML features limited to meta-refresh and <a>/<link> tag anomalies); no mention of testing against JS obfuscation, junk/invisible HTML, dynamic loading or cloaking."}
