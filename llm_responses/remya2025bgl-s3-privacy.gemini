    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The proposed method requires the full URL and extensive external metadata features for its analysis, including WHOIS registration details, DNS records, domain age, and server details. In a real-world deployment for detecting new URLs, acquiring this metadata would necessitate sending the domain or URL to external servers for lookups, thereby revealing the user's browsing activity. The paper does not describe any client-side or on-device inference model. It also makes no mention of any privacy-preserving mechanisms such as URL hashing, federated learning, or transmitting anonymized feature vectors. The architecture implies a centralized, server-side analysis where the user's full URL is processed. Based on the codebook, the absence of any discussion on inference-time data handling or privacy safeguards defaults the rating to 'Low'.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, Section VI, 'd: METADATA FEATURES': 'WHOIS Registration Details: These include critical information such as the creation date, expiry date, and update frequency of the domain. Newly created domains with imminent expiry dates are often red flags... DNS Records: Analysis of DNS records can reveal patterns typical of phishing domains, such as irregularities in the setup or management of DNS entries.'\nPage 7, TABLE 3. Feature set overview: The table lists feature types required for the model, including 'Metadata Features' with examples such as 'WHOIS Information, SSL Presence, DNS Records'.\nPage 8, Section VII, 'C. LIGHTGBM: METADATA-BASED FEATURE ANALYSIS': 'Metadata features such as domain age, SSL presence, and WHOIS data are processed by LightGBM.'\nThe paper provides no details on how this sensitive data is handled at inference time to protect user privacy."
