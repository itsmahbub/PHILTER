{"value":"Medium","why":"The evaluation dataset includes low-reputation/long-tail domains (by crawling Tranco-ranked sites from positions 100,000–105,000 alongside the top 10,000), but there is no mention of explicitly including benign pages with legitimate brand-element usage (e.g., PayPal buttons, social media widgets).","evidence":"Section IV.A, pg. 4: “For benign pages, we visited the top-ranked websites from the Tranco list. Specifically, we crawled the top 10,000 ranked domains and those that ranked between 100,000 and 105,000…” (no reference to including pages with genuine brand elements)"}
