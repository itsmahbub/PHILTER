{"value":"Medium","why":"While the paper includes precision, F1‐score, ROC/AUC, and MCC, it does not explicitly report recall, omitting a key class‐sensitive metric required under class imbalance. Thus it lacks full metric coverage.","evidence":"Page 15 (Section V, Table 4): Column headers list ROC, AUC, Log Loss, MCC, Precision, F1‐Score, and Accuracy—but no Recall is provided."}
