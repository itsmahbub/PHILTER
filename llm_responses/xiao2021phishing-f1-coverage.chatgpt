{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed URL-only CNN with self-attention is evaluated on a generic phishing vs. legitimate URL dataset without any consideration or labeling of different phishing tactics (e.g., subdomain spoofing, homograph attacks, IP-address URLs), nor is there any per-tactic performance breakdown. Thus it ignores tactic diversity.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 5.1: “We collect 68030 legitimate URLs … and 12003 phishing URLs … We randomly extract 4000 legitimate URLs and 4000 phishing URLs to form the test dataset. … Table 1 enumerates the composition of the training dataset.” (no tactic labels or breakdown)"}
