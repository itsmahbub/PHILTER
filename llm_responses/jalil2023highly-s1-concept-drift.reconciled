{"value":"Low","why":"The method uses a fixed set of 30 lexical URL features and a one‐time, random 70/30 train/test split. It does not include any adaptive or continual learning strategy, does not leverage inherently time-stable features to guard against evolving phishing tactics, and its evaluation does not simulate temporal (train-on-past, test-on-future) deployment. Thus it assumes tactics remain static and offers no concept-drift resilience.","evidence":"Page 9237, Section 3.3 “we have used 70% data for training the models and 30% data for testing the models.”; Page 9241, Table 3 “List of proposed 30 features” – a static feature set with no update or adaptation mechanism described."}
