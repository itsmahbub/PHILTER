{"value":"Low","why":"CatchPhish is built around Siamese neural networks and distance‐based decision thresholds without any mechanism to expose decision logic or feature contributions. The method does not employ inherently interpretable models nor post hoc XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention maps) to explain individual predictions or provide global feature insights. It functions as a pure black‐box classifier.","evidence":"Pages 4–6, Section III.C and IV: The paper describes only the Siamese network architecture, tokenization, distance metrics (Euclidean/Manhattan) and classification thresholds, with no mention of interpretability or explainability modules."}
