{"value":"Low","why":"The paper applies off-the-shelf classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, kNN, etc.) to engineered URL-based features but does not expose per-decision paths, nor does it report feature importances or employ any XAI/post-hoc explanation techniques. All evaluation focuses on aggregate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure) with no mechanism to explain or audit why a given URL is flagged.","evidence":"Page 8, Section 5.1: “In this paper, we have used seven different classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, kNN (n = 3), Adaboost, K-star, SMO and Decision Tree)….” — no mention of model explanations or interpretable outputs; Page 10, Section 5.5: evaluation presents only accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F-measure (Eqs. 2–5, Table 5), with no discussion of feature importance or decision paths."}
