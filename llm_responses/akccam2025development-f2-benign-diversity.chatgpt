{"value":"Low","why":"The evaluation uses only publicly available benchmark datasets (GramBeddings, Malicious & Benign URLs, Ebbu2017, and Mendeley Data) without any indication that the benign pages include low-reputation or long-tail domains or legitimate brand-element usage. Thus the reported false positive rate may not reflect robustness against “hard” benign cases.","evidence":"Page 5, Section 3.2 “Datasets”: “To address the problem of URL phishing classification, this study utilised four publicly available datasets … The first dataset is the GramBeddings Dataset … The second dataset, the Malicious and Benign URLs Dataset … The third dataset, the Ebbu2017 Phishing Dataset … The final dataset is the Mendeley Data Web Page Phishing Detection Dataset.” No mention of low-reputation or brand-element subsets."}
