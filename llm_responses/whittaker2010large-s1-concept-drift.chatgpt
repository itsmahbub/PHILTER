{"value":"High","why":"The proposed system employs an adaptive strategy—daily retraining on a sliding three-month window of data—to accommodate evolving phishing tactics, and its evaluation protocol explicitly tests models on temporally forward data (training on April–July data and testing on August data) to demonstrate robustness to concept drift.","evidence":"Section 3.3 (Training Process): “We retrain this classifier daily using approximately ten million samples from classification data collected over the last three months.”; Section 4.3 (Classifier Performance): “Candidate model tested on data collected between August 1, 2009 and August 14, 2009.”"}
