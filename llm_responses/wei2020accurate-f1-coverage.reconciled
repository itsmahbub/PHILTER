{"value":"Low","why":"Although the paper’s introduction describes a variety of phishing tactics (typosquatting, bitsquatting, homograph attacks, punycode, etc.), the authors do not report any annotation or quantitative breakdown of which tactics are present in their evaluation dataset, nor do they present per-tactic performance results. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements for ‘Medium’ and falls into the ‘Low’ category.","evidence":"Section 4.1 (page 5): “Our experiments are based on publicly available PhishTank phishing sites database [30]. The database downloaded during the article writing contained 10,604 records….”; Section 5 (pages 6–7): Evaluation reports only overall accuracy and ROC curves, with no breakdown by phishing tactic."}
