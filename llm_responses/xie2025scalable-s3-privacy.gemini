    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper does not provide any details on the deployment architecture or data handling during real-time inference. The proposed model, SPWDM, requires a wide range of features for its operation, including URL components, HTML content, server response information, and dynamic features gathered by simulating user interaction. To acquire these features in a real-world application (e.g., a browser extension), the system would need access to the full URL and the complete webpage content. The paper makes no mention of client-side inference, privacy-preserving techniques like hashing or federated learning, or any safeguards to prevent sensitive user data from being transmitted to an external server. The evaluation is conducted entirely on pre-collected, static datasets, with no consideration for the privacy implications of a live deployment. As per the codebook, a 'Low' rating is assigned when 'no inference-time data-handling details are given'.",
    "evidence": "Page 6, TABLE I, Feature extraction status: The table lists the features required by the model, which include 'URL information', 'HTML information', 'Response information', and 'Dynamic information'. Acquiring these features, particularly HTML, response, and dynamic ones, necessitates accessing the full webpage, which is highly sensitive user data.\n\nPage 8-10, Section 4, Methodology: This section details the model's architecture (SPWDM) and how it processes the various input features. However, it never specifies whether this processing is intended to happen locally on a user's device or on a remote server. The paper is silent on the critical aspect of data flow in a deployment scenario.\n\nThroughout the paper: There is a complete absence of terms or concepts related to privacy preservation, such as 'client-side', 'local inference', 'federated learning', 'hashing', or 'anonymization' in the context of the detection process."
