    "why": "The proposed method, CatchPhish, is designed around a feature that is inherently stable against concept drift: brand identity. By using a Siamese Neural Network to measure typographical similarity between a suspicious term and a known brand name, the model targets the persistent phishing tactic of brand impersonation via typosquatting. As long as attackers continue to impersonate major brands, this core detection principle remains relevant. However, the paper's evaluation methodology does not validate this long-term robustness. The dataset is synthetically generated based on a list of brands popular in 2020 and then randomly split for training and testing. There is no temporal separation in the evaluation (e.g., training on older data and testing on newer data) to prove that the model's performance holds up against the evolution of attack techniques over time.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section III.A, Construction of the database: 'The first step of CatchPhish is building the database. With the target brands already defined and seeking to build a self-sufficient model in the generation of databases... it was proposed to build an application capable of elaborating distorted terms (typosquatting) referring to the selected brands... giving rise to a labeled database, composed of 33,077 distorted terms. At the end of the construction, the data are divided into training and validation sets, respecting the proportion of 60% for training, 20% for test and 20% for validation.'\n\nThis quote demonstrates that while the method is based on the stable concept of brand impersonation, the evaluation is based on a single, synthetically generated dataset that is randomly split, not chronologically. This fails to test the model's resilience to concept drift over time."
