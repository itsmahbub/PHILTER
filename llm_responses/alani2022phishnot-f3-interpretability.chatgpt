{"value":"Medium","why":"PhishNot uses a Random Forest ensemble (a black-box at the instance level) but provides global insight into the model via feature importance scores (e.g., Fig. 11) used for recursive feature elimination. It does not offer per-decision explanations (no SHAP/LIME or decision-path traceability), only overall feature rankings.","evidence":"Page 9, Section 6.2 (“Fig. 11 shows the feature importance of the 14 selected features.”); Page 6, Section 5.5 (feature importance used for recursive feature elimination)."}
