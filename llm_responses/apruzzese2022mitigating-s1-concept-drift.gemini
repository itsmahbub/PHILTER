    "value": "Medium",
    "why": "The paper explicitly acknowledges the problem of concept drift and proposes periodic retraining as the solution. The Protective Operation Chain (POC) method is designed to enhance the security of this retraining process by creating a new, randomized feature space each time, forcing attackers to re-adapt. This aligns with the 'employing adaptive strategies' criterion. However, the paper's experimental evaluation does not validate this approach through a temporally aware protocol. All experiments are conducted using a standard 80/20 random split within static datasets collected at specific points in time. There is no evaluation where the model is trained on older data and tested on newer data to measure its resilience to natural concept drift. Because the paper proposes a strategy to handle drift but does not evaluate it temporally, it meets one of the two criteria for a 'Medium' rating.",
    "evidence": "Page 7, Section 5.2, Goal of POC: \"Moreover, as described in Section 3.4, ML detectors must be updated with new data to prevent concept drift [40], [78]. Therefore, each new application of POC will result in a new feature space, ensuring that attackers that ‘cracked’ the old PDs have to repeat the process again.\"\n\nPage 14, Section 7.4, Takeaway Message: \"...even if an attacker were able to fully ‘crack’ a POC-hardened PD and infer its feature set, the attacker must repeat the process when the PD is periodically updated (to mitigate concept-drift [40]) with more recent data, as the feature mapping is likely to change.\"\n\nPage 8, Section 6.1, Testbed: \"We apply an 80:20 split for the training and test partitions, where the proportion of benign-to-malicious samples is as reported in Table 1.\" (This confirms a standard random split, not a temporal one.)"
