{"value":"Low","why":"The paper evaluates AdaptPUD solely on standard phishing vs. benign URL datasets (including concept‐drift scenarios) without any experiments that simulate or test resilience against active evasive manipulations of URLs (e.g., injected junk characters, adversarial perturbations, encoding or Punycode obfuscations). Thus, it provides no assessment of robustness to active attacks within its URL‐only input modality.","evidence":"Section 5.3 (Comparative studies): “First, comparative experiments of the performance metrics for all models are conducted on the test set of Dataset-1. Subsequently, a second set of comparative experiments is performed on the entire Dataset-2 to assess and evaluate the robustness of all models under concept drift.” No active‐attack or adversarial‐evasion tests are reported."}
