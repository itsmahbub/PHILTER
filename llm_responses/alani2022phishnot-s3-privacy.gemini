    "why": "The proposed system, PhishNot, operates on a client-server model where the full, unfiltered URL is transmitted from the user's device (client) to an external cloud-based server for inference. The paper's architecture diagrams and deployment descriptions explicitly detail this process, showing that the raw URL is captured and sent as a parameter in an HTTP API call. This approach does not employ any privacy-preserving mechanisms such as hashing, client-side feature extraction, or URL sanitization. Transmitting complete URLs to a third-party server creates a significant privacy risk, as URLs can contain sensitive information like session tokens, personal identifiers, or query parameters specific to a user's activity.",
    "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3, \"At the deployment stage, the client captures the URL and sends it through an API call to the cloud-based server. As the URL might contain one or more symbols, the URL is encoded using UTF-8 encoding and then sent in a simple API call with the URL as an HTTP parameter. The server receives the URL, extracts the features...\"\n\nPage 8, Section 5.8, \"The process starts with the client sending an HTTP request to the running web service. The format of the request is http://serveraddress/?url=URL-to-inspect, where URL-to-inspect is the URL that the system must inspect to flag as 'phishing' or 'benign'. All URLs passed to the server must be encoded using URI encoding [31].\"\n\nPage 9, Figure 8, The figure provides a concrete example of an API call, showing a full phishing URL being sent as a parameter to the server: `ec2-3-99-132-126.ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yterwyiqo.cam%2F6dd5j239k5pC8q612r1290aA2850Y`"
