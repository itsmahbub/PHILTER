    "why": "The proposed method, MFPD, is a two-stage system that relies on a CNN-LSTM model and an XGBoost classifier. Both of these models are treated as black boxes. The paper provides no mechanism to explain why a particular URL is classified as phishing or legitimate. There is no mention of applying any Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as attention mechanisms or saliency maps for the deep learning component, nor is there any discussion of extracting feature importances or decision paths from the XGBoost model. The system's design focuses exclusively on balancing detection accuracy and speed, without incorporating any features for interpretability or auditing of its predictions.",
    "evidence": "Page 5, Section IV, OVERVIEW OF ALGORITHM. The paper describes the two main components: \"the CNN-LSTM algorithm\" and \"the phishing detection method based on multidimensional features\". The CNN-LSTM architecture (Figure 3) is a standard deep learning pipeline that outputs a probability without explanation. The multidimensional feature method combines various handcrafted features with the CNN-LSTM output and feeds them into an XGBoost classifier (Figure 7). The paper states: \"The classifier used in the multidimensional feature algorithm is the XGBoost... which has high classification accuracy.\" (Page 9, Section V). The entire discussion of the models is centered on their predictive performance and speed, not on the transparency of their decision-making process. No methods for interpreting the models' outputs are proposed or evaluated."
