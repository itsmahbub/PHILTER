    "value": "High",
    "why": "The paper provides a robust and comprehensive evaluation of the proposed phishing detection method. It explicitly reports all required class-sensitive metrics (precision, recall/sensitivity, and F1-score) across multiple experimental scenarios. Furthermore, it includes a required summary metric, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), to assess overall classification quality. This thorough approach goes well beyond simple accuracy, allowing for a meaningful assessment of the model's performance under class imbalance, which is critical for phishing detection.",
    "evidence": "Page 11, Section 3.6, \"It is considered that the detection of phishing websites is a binary classification...there are typical metrics used in the literature to evaluate classifier performance, mainly accuracy, F1 score, precision, specificity, sensitivity... To introduce Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) and Area Under ROC Curve (AUC), we have to discuss True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).\"\nPage 14, Table 13, \"Performance comparison (%) of all the algorithms after hyperparameter tuning for the fourth scenario (S4).\" This table presents results for all algorithms, with dedicated columns for \"Precision\", \"Recall\", and \"F1-score\".\nPage 14, Table 14, \"ROC_AUC score for the fourth scenario (S4) after hyperparameter tuning.\" This table explicitly reports the \"ROC_AUC score (%)\" for each of the six tested algorithms, fulfilling the requirement for a summary metric."
