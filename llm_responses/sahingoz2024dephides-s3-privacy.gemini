    "value": "Low",
    "why": "The paper provides no details on the deployment architecture or how user data is handled during inference. The proposed method processes the full, raw URL string to generate character-level embeddings. Since the paper does not describe any on-device/client-side implementation, nor mentions any privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., hashing, feature anonymization), it fails to demonstrate that user privacy is protected. According to the codebook, a 'Low' rating is assigned when 'no inference-time data-handling details are given (i.e., there is no mention of any client-side or in-boundary deployment and no privacy safeguards are described)'. The paper's focus is entirely on model training and performance evaluation, without addressing the critical privacy implications of a real-world deployment.",
    "evidence": "page 17, Section VI.C, REAL-TIME EXECUTION: 'As phishing attackers can quickly create fraudulent web pages that are active for short durations, real-time detection is essential for effective prevention. The proposed system can classify over 130,070 URLs per second, making it suitable for deployment in high-traffic environments.' \n\nThis section, along with others, discusses the system's suitability for real-world use based on its speed, but it never specifies the deployment model (e.g., a server-side API requiring URL submission vs. a local client). The paper lacks any section on system architecture, deployment, or privacy considerations, leaving the data handling process at inference time completely undefined."
