    "why": "The proposed method, PhishFencing, addresses multiple phishing tactics through its core design. By relying on visual identity (logos) and network identity (host features like IP, AS, geolocation), it is inherently resistant to URL-based evasion tactics such as domain squatting or lexical manipulation, which the paper explicitly mentions as a weakness of other approaches. A key contribution is its dedicated mechanism for partially detecting phishing on HTTPS servers by analyzing SNI fields, a prevalent and challenging tactic. The evaluation reflects this focus by providing a quantitative breakdown of the dataset into HTTP and HTTPS pages and reporting separate performance for each protocol. However, the paper falls short of a 'High' rating because this per-tactic analysis is not comprehensive. The evaluation does not offer a breakdown for other important tactics like phishing on compromised domains or trusted shared hosting, although these are acknowledged as limitations. Furthermore, the experiment is restricted to only eight highly popular brands, failing to demonstrate coverage for attacks targeting a wider or less common range of entities.",
    "evidence": "1. **Handling HTTPS Tactic**: \"we propose the first approach that is able to partially identify phishing websites hosted on HTTPS servers without requiring any interaction with the client computer/browser\" (Page 3, Section 1).\n2. **Dataset Breakdown by Protocol**: \"only 772 URLs remained as valid phishing URLs (majority of the phishing websites went offline after a very short lifespan), in which 48.7% are hosted on HTTP and 51.3% are hosted on HTTPS.\" (Page 11, Section 5.1).\n3. **Performance Breakdown by Protocol**: \"Then we evaluate the performance of Phish-Fencing on HTTPS streams... The results show that PhishFencing achieved 26.32% recall on HTTPS-hosted phishing websites, when it is deployed at the gateway...\" (Page 14, Section 5.3). Figure 7 on the same page provides a visual comparison of performance on HTTP vs. HTTPS.\n4. **Resilience to URL Tactics by Design**: \"For URLs, adversaries may use squatting domain [26] to imitate target sites’ URLs, while others construct normal but totally irrelevant URLs to overpass detection [2]... Features used in PhishFencing are listed in Table 1.\" (Page 4, Section 3.1). The selected features (logo, screenshot, IP, AS, geolocation) are chosen specifically to be more stable and harder to manipulate than URL strings.\n5. **Limited Brand Diversity**: \"We followed SquatPhish [26] to select 8 most frequently targeted brands, which cover 68.98% of the phishing webpages in our groundtruth dataset. They are paypal, microsoft, facebook, google, amazon, apple, dropbox, and yahoo.\" (Page 11, Section 5.1)."
