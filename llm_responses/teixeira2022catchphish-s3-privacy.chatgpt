{"value":"Low","why":"The paper makes no mention of any privacy-preserving deployment or data-handling mechanisms at inference time. It does not describe running the detection entirely on the client device, nor does it employ hashed lookups, federated learning, or anonymized feature vectors. Consequently, it appears that full URLs or page content would need to be sent off-device for classification, and no safeguards are described.","evidence":"Section III (pages 4–5): The CatchPhish methodology is described in terms of database construction, preprocessing, model training, and classification, but there is no discussion of client-side execution or privacy-preserving handling of user data; no inference-time data-handling details are provided."}
