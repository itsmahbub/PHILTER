{"value":"Low","why":"The proposed system only evaluates static URL-based features on a clean phishing vs. benign dataset. There is no discussion or experimentation involving deliberate evasive or adversarial manipulations (e.g. obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, invisible elements, URL‐level obfuscations beyond simple lexical features), dynamic content loading, or cloaking. Thus it provides no demonstrated robustness against active evasion attacks within its URL‐level scope.","evidence":"Page 8, Section III.A “URL BASED PHISHING DATASET”: “The dataset consisted of 11054 number of records and 33 attributes… The phishing and legitimate website URLs contain some common attributes such as UsingIP, LongURL, ShortURL, Symbol@, Redirecting//, PrefixSuffix-, SubDomains, HTTPS… which help to identify whether the URL is phishing.” No further evaluation of adversarial or evasive URL manipulations is presented."}
