{"value":"Low","why":"The paper provides no empirical evaluation of the classifier’s resilience to active evasion techniques. All testing is done on ‘clean’ phishing and benign examples drawn from spam and user reports; there is no assessment against obfuscated JavaScript, junk HTML, dynamic content loading, cloaking, or other adversarial manipulations within its HTML‐page input scope.","evidence":"Page 6, Section 3.4 (“Potential Adversarial Attacks”): describes possible bypasses but presents no experimental results; Section 4 (Evaluation): performance is measured only on unmanipulated phishing vs. benign datasets without testing any active attack scenarios."}
