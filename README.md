# PHILTER

**PH**ishing detection literature **I**nspection via **L**LMs and **T**argeted **E**xpert **R**eview.

PHILTER is a transparent, scalable framework for assessing AI-based phishing website detection papers against seven deployment-relevant requirements: four **Functionality** metrics (F1–F4) and three **Security** metrics (S1–S3). LLMs extract evidence and draft rationales; **experts validate and finalize all labels**. Applying PHILTER to 55 studies reveals systemic gaps and trade-offs.

## Quick start

Put the research papers on phishing website detection inside `papers` directory.

```bash
# 1) Create env (Python 3.10–3.12 recommended)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Set OpenAI and Gemini API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...

# 4) Run LLM-assisted prelimiary evaluation stage
python llm_assessment_pipeline.py -p . -m codebook/f1-coverage.txt -o assessments.json
```

## Contents of assessments.json

This file contains the structured evaluation results for each phishing website detection paper analyzed in our study. Each entry corresponds to a single paper and includes:

- **Metadata**: Year, venue, citation count, method name, and paper key.  
- **Category & Inputs**: Detection strategy category (e.g., feature-based, similarity-based, identity-based, hybrid) and input requirements (e.g., URL, webpage content).  
- **Performance Metrics**: Reported accuracy, precision, recall, and F1, detection mode (real-time vs. offline), deployment mode (client-side vs. server-side).  
- **Codebook Metrics**: Evaluations under the PHILTER framework. For each metric, multiple assessments are stored:  
  - `manual`: Expert’s final label.  
  - `manual_reasoning`: Explanation for the manual label.  
  - `chatgpt`: Assessment generated by ChatGPT (includes value, reasoning, and supporting evidence).  
  - `gemini`: Assessment generated by Gemini (includes value, reasoning, and supporting evidence). 
  - `arbitrator`: Final reconciled label after resolving disagreements (includes value, reasoning, and supporting evidence).

  Metrics include:  
  - **F1 – Diversity of Phishing Tactics**  
  - **F2 – Diversity of Benign Pages**  
  - **F3 – Interpretability**  
  - **F4 – Evaluation Transparency**  
  - **S1 – Adaptation to Concept Drift**  
  - **S2 – Resistance to Active Attacks**  
  - **S3 – Privacy Preservation**
